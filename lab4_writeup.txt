I & II. Test suite instances and choices for starter grammar

A. Possessives

Possession in Tibetan is indicated by the genitive case on the possessor which precedes the possessum:

Unfortunately, the only full examples we found with pronominal possession also involved subject dropping:

Source: b:160
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: poss, pro-d
ngali   nyigdugs        lus     1dug
nga-li  nyigdugs        lus     1dug
I-GEN   umbrella        leave   AUX
"I've left my umbrella behind (I remember doing so)"

We made a coresponding ungrammatical example with incorrect order and an added subject:

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: poss
ngas    nyigdugs        ngali   lus     1dug
nga-s   nyigdugs	nga-li  lus     1dug
I-ERG   umbrella.ABS	I-GEN   leave   AUX
"I've left my umbrella behind (I remember doing so)"


Reading the text, we have not found evidence of inalienable possession being any different from alienable possession. Furthermore, we found a fragment for my hand which we haven't put in the testsuite since it is a fragment

Source: b:102
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: poss
nga1i   lagpa
nga-1i  lagpa
I-GEN   hand
"My hand"

We found possessive noun phrases fragments which we made into a full sentence:

khong-gi        11awa-1i        pheb1gro        nak-po          re
He-GEN          child-GEN       car.ABS         black-NMZ       be
"His child's car is black"


Choices: 

B. Matrix yes-no questions

Yes-no questions involve putting the INTERR mood marker on the end of the last verb in the sentence as all mood markers do in Tibetan.

Unfortunately, the simplest examples involved copular verbs; since we couldn't get copular constructions to work with NPs, we interpreted Tibetan as an adjective:

# Source C(285):
# Yes-no questions are marked by the final particle pas which assimilates to a preceding underlying velar

Source: c:285
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: q, cop
kho     bodpa           redpas
kho     bodpa           red-pas
He      Tibetan         be-Q
"Is he a Tibetan?"

For yes-no questions involving other types of verbs, we have this example; this demonstrates that the question morpheme pas is assimilated to velar sounds it is near:

#ngas should be pas but is assimilated
Source: c:285
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: q
khyedrang       bodla           phebs   myongngas
khyedrang       bod-la          phebs   myong-ngas
you             Tibet-DAT       go.HON  experiential.AUX-Q
"Have you ever been to Tibet?"

We have a corresponding ungrammatical example with the morpheme on the wrong verb:

#Made up example with Q marker on wrong verb
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: q
khyedrang       bodla           phebspas        myongngas
khyedrang       bod-la          phebs-pas       myong-ngas
you             Tibet-DAT       go.HON-Q        experiential-Q
"Have you ever been to Tibet"

Choices:

C. Declarative clausal complements and yes-no questions as clausal complements

In Tibetan, declarative clausal complements appear as full clauses with  nominalized verbs at the end. 

For embedded complement clauses, we were only able to find examples of declarative embedded clauses:

# Source C 284
# "Most complement clauses are nominalizations. The nominalizers most commonly used
# as complementizers are pa, yag rgyu and gag. The complement of a verb of perception
# or cognition can be a finite clause nominalized with -pa"
#

Source: c:284
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: emb-d
ngas    kho     laska   byed    kyi     yodpa           mthong  byung
nga-s   kho     laska   byed    kyi     yod-pa          mthong  byung
I-ERG   he      work    do      AUX     exist-NMZ       see     PRF
"I see he is working"

We have a corresponding ungrammatical example without the nominalization

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: emb-d
ngas    kho     laska   byed    kyi     yod             mthong  byung
nga-s   kho     laska   byed    kyi     yod             mthong  byung
I-ERG   he      work    do      AUX     exist           see     PRF
"I see he is working"

For embedded interrogative clausal complements, we were not able to find any examples. One reason is that according to source d, indirect and direct speech are represented in the same way in morphology and are distinguished by :

"Reported speech is indicated by the marker /s/ which corresponds to closing quotation marks. This marker /s/, derived from the verb /ser/ to say, is used for both direct and indirect speech [...] The distinguishing feature of reported speech in Tibetan is that it is inserted between the author of the quotation and the verb of speech[...] If it happens that the source of a quotation is the same person as someone who is mentioned in it, or else is the actual speaker, Tibetans prefer to substitute 'hybrid' reported speech for direct speech " (Source D 214-215)

Source C states that the 's' marker is optional and  does not even refer to the sentences as indirect or direct speech but rather "finite" verbal complements: "Finite complements occur with verbs of speech. These may be unmarked or marked with the complementizer ze, usually pronounced as the semi-syllabic [s]" (284). 


Another lead for possible embedded interrogative clausal complements was the dubatative mood marker because it corresponds with 'whether', but by following all of its uses in Source B, we found no sentences which contained complements; we added an example to tense, aspect and mood:

Source: b:128
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tam
gsar1gyur       11eyod
gsar1gyur       11e-yod
news            DUB-exist
"I wonder whether there's any news"

A final lead was looking for question words in sentences. This yielded the altnerative marker on verbs which can appear at the end of a clause or at the end of the sentence. This makes it an impossible marker for complementation.

# Source B desc p. 120: There are also 'alternative' forms yin.nam yod.dam and 'dug.gam [...] These forms can also be used with or without an interrogative noun to express a more tentative inquiry than the interrogative or wh-interrogative forms

Source: c:131
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: ???
khong   su      yinnam  ngas    hago    mabyung 
khong   su      yin-nam nga-s   hago    ma-byung
she.ABS who     be-alt  I-ERG   know    NEG-PRF
"I don't know who she might be."

Source: c:226
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: ???
khyedrang      ngangla         maphyinpa       gare    yinnam
khyedrang      ngang-la        ma-phyin-pa     gare    yin-nam
you            home-DAT        NEG-went-NMZ    why     be-ALT
"Why didn't you go home?"

As we couldn't classify the phenomenon, we did not include these examples in our testsuite. We commented them out in our emb-d section. Rather than complementation, the second example is likely some sort of serial verb construction: "Who is she? I don't know"

Choices:

D. Clausal Modifiers

Clausal modifiers appear as words which follow the subordinated clause. One with many examples is "byas" which implies a series of events.

Source: b:173
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: cl-mod
kho     laska   byas    byas    nangla          bsdad   pared
kho     laska   byas    byas    nang-la         bsdad   pa-red
3sg     work    did     did     home-DAT        stay    LK-AUX
"He worked and then stayed home" 

Without the second byas, the sentence becomes a serial verb construction / coordination:

Source: b:173
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: svc, crd
kho     laska   byas    nangla          bsdad   pared
kho     laska   byas    nang-la         bsdad   pa-red
3sg     work    did     home-DAT        stay    LK-AUX
"He worked and stayed home"

Some of the requirements for these clausal modifiers are more involved; for "before," the verb of the subordinated clause must be negated. 

Source: b:283
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: cl-mod
kho     rgyagarla       ma1gro  khongla         dngul   mangpo  bsags   pared
kho     rgyagar-la      ma-1gro khongla         dngul   mangpo  bsags   pa-red
he      India-DAT       NEG-go  before          money   much    save    LK-AUX
"Before he went to India, he saved a lot of money"

Choices:

E. Argument Optionality

In examples we have collected so far, there are many examples of pronoun dropping. As shown in the negation section, there are examples of dropped subjects. 

Here is an example of a dropped object:

Source: b:146
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, neg, tam, pro-d
khonggis   magnang  pared
khong-gis  ma-gnang pa-red
3SG-ERG    NEG-give LK-AUX
"He didn't give it."

Choices:

F. Nominalization

III. Testsuite instances not yet covered

We do not parse any of the testsuite instances dealing with:
* Wh-Questions
* Aspect & Tense
* Auxiliary verbs  
* Adjunct phrases (instrumental verbs)

IV. Coverage and Overgeneration

As of 12:00 on 2018-01-18, the numbers for our 45 items are as follows:

A. Coverage: 14 / 30 positive instances (47%)
B. Overgeneration: 0 / 15 (0%)

For the 16 items in positive examples, we are missing tokens in our lexicon. 4 of the items dealing with pronouns do not parse because they use of auxiliary verbs such as:

Source: b:178
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: pn, wo
nga 'gro dgosred
nga 'gro-dgos_red
I   go-LK_AUX
'I  must go.'

The next group which does not parse includes auxiliary verbs which illustrate the tenses such as this:

#FUTURE TENSE
Source: b:137
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c, tam
sangnyin  ngas    laska  'di   byedkyiyin
sangnyin  nga-s    laska  'di   byed-kyi-yin
tomorrow  1ST-SBJ  work   this  do-LK-AUX
'He is sure to do the work.'

The final major group are questions which include question words

Source: b:130
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: c,
kyedrang   su    yin-pa
kyedrang   su    yin-pa
2ND         who   be-wh.interr
'Who are you?'

There were no incorrectly parsed sentences.

V. Outside domain of customization

One area where the customization system had challenges was creating multiple adopositions as clitics marking case. When we added two adpositions marking the same case, the system failed to parse either. Since we have simple exampels of nouns so far, we have used morphological rules.

Another issue we have had, is that auxiliary verbs do not seem to be created with orthographic strings even when the stem is specified. 

Another issue is that it seems we cannot yet describe ditransitive verbs because there are only slots for subj and object. This is out of the scope of the class I gather.
