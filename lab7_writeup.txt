A. One more corpus sentence

We decided to parse the question to last week's answer from the corpus: 

Source: b:275
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena:q
bodla           dgunkha         zhedrag grangmo         yogred-bas
bod-la          dgunkha         zhedrag grang-mo        yogred-bas
Tibet-DAT       winter.ABS      very    cold-NMZ        exist-INTERR
"Are winters very cold in Tibet?"

To add this, we needed prepositional phrases, ideally deriveable from case; to do so, we added the locative noun phrase suggested to us on the forums:

locative-pp-phrase := unary-phrase &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD adp & [ MOD < [ LOCAL  intersective-mod &
                                                    [ CAT.HEAD verb ] ] > ],
                          VAL [ COMPS < >,
                                SUBJ < >,
                                SPR < > ]]],
    C-CONT [ HOOK [ LTOP #ltop,
                    INDEX #index,
                    XARG #xarg ],
             RELS <! arg12-ev-relation &
                   [ PRED "_loc_p_rel",
                     LBL #ltop,
                     ARG0 #index,
                     ARG1 #xarg,
                     ARG2 #dtr ] !>,
             HCONS <! !>  ],
    ARGS < [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD noun & [CASE dat],
                                  VAL.SPR < > ],
                            CONT.HOOK [ INDEX #dtr ]]] > ].


A minor change from the example was required, removing SYNSEM.

  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD adp & [ MOD < [ SYNSEM.LOCAL intersective-mod &

With intensifiers and copular verbs in place, the sentence parses and the correct MRS is present. However, there are interpretations which involve the contraction rule which currently introduces negation.

B. Variable property mapping

For MT, we introduced the following changes to VPM. We removed E. from TENSE, ASPECT and MOOD. We removed PNG from PER and NUM.


To improve results for generation and MT, we gave reasonable default types for TENSE, ASPECT and MOOD:

  * >> present
  present << [e]

  * >> no-aspect
  no-aspect << [e]

  * >> indic
  indic << [e]


C. First MT

To translate, we added the relevant vocabulary and tested translation between Tibetan and English 

D. Grammar improvements

The current grammar includes an obligatory series of case classes on verbs which now make it possible to specify mood. 

With the rules in place, we had to add some rules to prevent the coordination of verbs aux verbs with their complements--we did this by constraining coordination to finite verbs.  

+vp-coord-phrase := event-coord-phrase &
+  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD verb,
+                       VAL.SUBJ < [ ] > ],
+    LCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD verb & [ FORM finite ],
+    RCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD verb & [ FORM finite ]].

+vp-bottom-coord-phrase := bottom-coord-phrase &
+  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD verb,
+                       VAL.SUBJ < [ ] > ],
+    NONCONJ-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD verb & [ FORM finite ],
+                                   VAL.SUBJ < [ ] > ]]



F. Coverage and Overgeneration

		Baseline	Current	
Coverage 	47/83		48/83
Ambiguity	1.81		2.34
Overgeneration	2/31		0/31

One reason that ambiguity has increased is that we now have issues with the wh-in-situ clause firing because mood is underspecified--we have interr specified but that will still unify with the underspecified "mood". With a forthcoming major refactoring of the grammar, we will have an obligatory succession of verb inflection rules which will allow us to take care of the underspecification issues.   
Another way in which ambiguity has increased is that the wh-pronoun seems to optionally go through either of the possessive inflection rules. Ideally, it would behave like nouns and go through the rule obligatorily.

Besides not parsing the sentence due to specifying FORM, we are also not parsing the previously mentioned negative nominalization example.

Since we are parsing at least two more wh-question sentences, this means that a few no longer parse--we have not been able to track them down.
