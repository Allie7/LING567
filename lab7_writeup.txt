Lab 7 Writeup

A. One more corpus sentence

We decided to parse the question to last week's answer from the corpus: 

Source: b:275
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena:q
bodla           dgunkha         zhedrag grangmo         yogredbas
bod-la          dgunkha         zhedrag grang-mo        yogred-bas
Tibet-LOC       winter.ABS      very    cold-NMZ        exist-INTERR
"Are winters very cold in Tibet?"

To add this, we needed prepositional phrases, ideally deriveable from case; to do so, we added the locative noun phrase suggested to us on the forums: 

locative-pp-phrase := unary-phrase &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD adp & [ MOD < [ LOCAL  intersective-mod &
                                                    [ CAT.HEAD verb ] ] > ],
                          VAL [ COMPS < >,
                                SUBJ < >,
                                SPR < > ]]],
    C-CONT [ HOOK [ LTOP #ltop,
                    INDEX #index,
                    XARG #xarg ],
             RELS <! arg12-ev-relation &
                   [ PRED "_loc_p_rel",
                     LBL #ltop,
                     ARG0 #index,
                     ARG1 #xarg,
                     ARG2 #dtr ] !>,
             HCONS <! !>  ],
    ARGS < [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD noun & [CASE loc],
                                  VAL.SPR < > ],
                            CONT.HOOK [ INDEX #dtr ]]] > ].

In Tibtan, locative cases are actually datives, at least they have the same case marker. However, it is clear not all dative case nouns can be locative PPs, and if we treat normal datives as locatives, our ambiguity would rise significantly. so we introduced an seperatate locatice case:

loc := case.

We also added a new time-location noun types and locative case marker rule, only that time-location nounts can undergo the locative case marker rule:

time-location-noun-lex := no-spr-noun-lex & 
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG [ PER 3rd,
				       NUM sg],
    INFLECTED [ CASE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG -,
		POSSESSIVE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG - ] ].

locative-rule := case-marker-lex-rule-super & infl-lex-rule &
  [ INFLECTED [ GENITIVE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG #genitive-lex-rule ],
    DTR time-location-noun-lex & [ INFLECTED [ GENITIVE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG #genitive-lex-rule ] ],
    SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.CASE loc ].


Please note that a minor change from the example on the 2017/lab6 page was required, removing SYNSEM from SYNSEM.LOCAL.

  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD adp & [ MOD < [ SYNSEM.LOCAL intersective-mod &

Though most sources identify dative and locative as one case in Tibetan, we introduced a separate locative case to cut down on ambiguity--we did not make this choice in an earlier implementation and had very high ambiguity. We have a substantial number of dative  words  and  words which could unfortunately appear as dative, khongla as khong-la ("before" as "3sg-DAT")

This required introducing a locative rule which expects time-location nouns:

locative-rule := case-marker-lex-rule-super & infl-lex-rule &
  [ INFLECTED [ GENITIVE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG #genitive-lex-rule ],
    DTR time-location-noun-lex & [ INFLECTED [ NOUN-LEX-FLAG +,
                    GENITIVE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG #genitive-lex-rule ] ],
    SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.CASE loc ].

time-location-noun-lex := no-spr-noun-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG [ PER 3rd,
                                       NUM sg],
    INFLECTED [ CASE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG -,
                POSSESSIVE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG - ] ].

With intensifiers and copular verbs in place, sentence produces 3 parses which are due to the wh-in-situ applying to each S node and the normal subj-head rule applying. Unfortunately, the MRS chain connecting the verb with phrasal index starts breaking at the comp-head phrase "zhedrag grangmo yogredbas".

B. Variable property mapping

For MT, we introduced the following changes to VPM. We removed E. from TENSE, ASPECT and MOOD. We removed PNG from PER and NUM.

To improve results for generation and MT, we gave reasonable default types for TENSE, ASPECT and MOOD:

  * >> no-tense
  no-tense << [e]

  * >> no-aspect
  no-aspect << [e]

  * >> indic
  indic << [e]

We have not introduced any major properties since the end of using the customization system, so no additional work was required.

C. First MT

To translate, we added the relevant vocabulary and tested translation between Tibetan and English. To do this, we added renamed PER values:

PNG.PER : PER
  3rd <> third
  2nd <> second
  1st <> first
  * <> *

We also mapped pl to sg because plural nouns tend to be mapped to sg because they are underspecified in Tibetan; we only inflect pronouns to plural at this point:

PNG.NUM : NUM
  pl <> sg
  sg <> sg


D. Grammar improvements

1.
In our previous grammar, verb inflections are not obligatory, and there were six of verb inflection position classes: sorted by order: polarity-marker(prefix), tense(prefix), aspect(prefix), aspect(suffix), mood(suffix) and nominalization rule(suffix). They were not obligatory, so that verbs' tam features were not always fully specified. This has caused a lot of problems, such as ambiguities resulted from wh-in-situ clause. Our grammar last week specified the wh-cl clauses to require [MOOD interr], however, since mood is not always fully specified, that specification does not always work. And when we generate, we either generate a lot of sentences with different tam values or can't generate at all. This week, we shrink them into four: polarity-marker, tense-aspect-prefix, aspect-mood-suffix, nominalization, and make all the verb inflections obligatory( all three are required for auxiliary verbs, main verbs do not undergo tense-aspect-prefix) except for nominalization. We added empty inflection lexical rule types to allow verbs without inflection markers to go through, below is an example snippet showing the mood-aspect-suffix-marker:

aux-lex := verb-lex &
 [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD.AUX +,
                      VAL.COMPS < [ OPT - ,
				    LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.NMZ -
					 ] > ],
   INFLECTED [  POLARITY-MARKER-FLAG -,
    	      	ASPECT-MOOD-SUFFIX-FLAG -,
		TENSE-ASPECT-PREFIX-FLAG -,
		NON-CONTRACTED-FORM-LEX-FLAG + ] ] .


(NON-CONTRACTED-FORM-LEX-FLAG is to forbid the non contracted forms of verbs to undergo contraction rule, an negation marker rule that does not require affixes).

  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX [ E.MOOD interr,

(indic marker does not have affixes, but it specified as FORM finite by inheriting the non-empty-suffix-rule to differentiate with empty-suffix-rule)

indic-marker-rule-lex-rule := non-empty-suffix-rule & const-lex-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX [ E.MOOD indic,
    				   SF prop ] ] ].

One benefit of this is that we were able to restrict the wh-int-cl to just interrogative verbs:

wh-int-cl := clause & head-compositional &  head-only &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ VAL #val,
                         MC bool ],
                     CONT.HOOK.INDEX.E.MOOD interr ],


(empty-suffix-rule is for the main verbs or auxiliaries that is not at the end of the verb series, it is specified as nonfinite to prevent them to be able stand at the end of whole VP)

empty-suffix-rule := aspect-mood-suffix-lex-rule-super & const-lex-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM nonfinite ].


simple-perfect-lex-rule := non-empty-suffix-rule & infl-lex-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX.E.ASPECT prf ],
    DTR [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM mv,
    	  INFLECTED.ASPECT-LEX-FLAG na ] ].

(non-empty-suffix-rule, specify the verb as FORM finite)

non-empty-suffix-rule := aspect-mood-suffix-lex-rule-super & 
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM finite ].

To prevent non-finite verbs/aux to attach at the end of VP, we also specify the the subj-head phrase to be finite:

 subj-head-phrase := bod-subj-head-phrase & head-final &
 +  [ HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ VAL.COMPS < >,
 +				HEAD.FORM finite ] ].


The polarity-marker and tense-aspect-prefix rules are implemented by similar stradegies. As we have said before, we also changed the semi.vpm to set default types. Doing those allow us to make all valid VPs to have tam features fully specified, so that generations can work, and the wh-in-situ ambiguities are prevented.


2. Follow-up on lab 6 and demo suggestions:

We fixed issues with the wh-pronouns by adding requirements for inflection just like other nouns:

    INFLECTED [ CASE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG -,
                POSSESSIVE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG -] ].

We added the suggestions to contrain NON-LOCAL values to nom clauses:

high-no-rel-nominalized-clause-phrase := unary-phrase:
...
	     NON-LOCAL #nl ],
...
	      NON-LOCAL #nl ] ] > ].

We added the suggestions for adjectives:

nom-adj-verb-lex-adj-lex := attr-adj-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ POSTHEAD +,
                       VAL.SUBJ < >,
                       HEAD.PRD + ] ].

We incorporated the changes to the grammar suggested in the demo class.

F. Coverage and Overgeneration

		Baseline	Current	
Coverage 	48/83		50/83
Ambiguity	2.31		1.66
Overgeneration	0/31		0/31

For the most part, we have fixed ambiguity issues with the wh-in-situ clause. One ambiguity issue with the wh-in-situ clause persists somewhat because it is not obligated to fire for every interrogative sentence as can be seen in the test corpus example--there is a valid parse without it.

Despite our solution to the ambiguity of PPs, some of it finds it way into our sentences. For example, the test corpus sentence from last week now has 8 parses due to the fact that arguments can be optional for the copular verb--which is suggested as the correct parse in the translation by the preposition. Alongside this, there are readings such as "A very cold Tibet exists", "In a very cold Tibet, <pro-d> exists," and "A very cold X exists in Tibet". Since this is the answer to the question "Are winters cold in Tibet?," something like the last is the most reasonable but incurs the most ambiguity.

Source: b:275
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena:adj
bodla           zhedrag grangmo         yogred
bod-la          zhedrag grang-mo        yogred
Tibet-DAT       very    cold-NMZ        exist
"It's very cold in Tibet"

We don't have issues with it applying everywhere though as in the first implementation because it is restricted to just a few nouns. Other sentences with increased ambiguity due to PPs are those which still have our previous DAT-accepting transitive verb:

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: emb-d
khos    nga     bodla           phyinpa         shes    kyi
kho-s   nga     bod-la          phyin-pa        shes    kyi
He-ERG  I.ABS   Tibet-DAT       go.PST-NMZ      know    AUX
"He knows I went to Tibet"


G. Outstanding issues

We have a few issues with our grammar.

1. The most important issue is that MRS chains are broken. The Index for the sentence does not attach to any of the MRS in the RELS list and there is an extra event in the ARG0 of the verb. Those two should be identified with each other, so we have some leads. 

2. Second of all, though our generations works after our modification with verb inflections, they fail to work at the last hours before deadline, displaying such warning messages:

Warning: invalid predicates: |"_letter_n_rel"|

Only common nouns and proper names are having such problems, sentences with only pronouns generates fine. We haven't figure out the reason yet.

3. The coordination rules and homographs of AUXs and verbs and affixes are still causing ambiguities. In sentences like :

Yige 	Medpa 	1DRA
Yige	med-pa	1dra
letter	neg-EXIST-NMZ seem
"the letter seems to be here"

"MED" is the contracted form of the verb "yod", which have auxiliary homographs "yod" and "med", "pa" is the nominalization marker, it has two homograph "-pa" that are interr mood marker and corrob mood markers. Coordination rule would coordinate medpa and 1dra. We have not figure out how to forbid that.
