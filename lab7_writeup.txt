A. One more corpus sentence

We decided to parse the question to last week's answer from the corpus: 

Source: b:275
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena:q
bodla           dgunkha         zhedrag grangmo         yogredbas
bod-la          dgunkha         zhedrag grang-mo        yogred-bas
Tibet-DAT       winter.ABS      very    cold-NMZ        exist-INTERR
"Are winters very cold in Tibet?"

To add this, we needed prepositional phrases, ideally deriveable from case; to do so, we added the locative noun phrase suggested to us on the forums: 

locative-pp-phrase := unary-phrase &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD adp & [ MOD < [ LOCAL  intersective-mod &
                                                    [ CAT.HEAD verb ] ] > ],
                          VAL [ COMPS < >,
                                SUBJ < >,
                                SPR < > ]]],
    C-CONT [ HOOK [ LTOP #ltop,
                    INDEX #index,
                    XARG #xarg ],
             RELS <! arg12-ev-relation &
                   [ PRED "_loc_p_rel",
                     LBL #ltop,
                     ARG0 #index,
                     ARG1 #xarg,
                     ARG2 #dtr ] !>,
             HCONS <! !>  ],
    ARGS < [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD noun & [CASE loc],
                                  VAL.SPR < > ],
                            CONT.HOOK [ INDEX #dtr ]]] > ].


A minor change from the example was required, removing SYNSEM.

  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD adp & [ MOD < [ SYNSEM.LOCAL intersective-mod &

Though most sources identify dative and locative as one case in Tibetan, we introduced a separate locative case to cut down on ambiguity. We have a substantial number of dative  words  and  words which could unfortunately appear as dative, khongla as khong-la ("before" as "3sg-DAT")

This required introducing a locative rule which expects time-location nouns:

locative-rule := case-marker-lex-rule-super & infl-lex-rule &
  [ INFLECTED [ GENITIVE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG #genitive-lex-rule ],
    DTR time-location-noun-lex & [ INFLECTED [ NOUN-LEX-FLAG +,
                    GENITIVE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG #genitive-lex-rule ] ],
    SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.CASE loc ].

time-location-noun-lex := no-spr-noun-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG [ PER 3rd,
                                       NUM sg],
    INFLECTED [ CASE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG -,
                POSSESSIVE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG - ] ].


With intensifiers and copular verbs in place, sentence produces 3 parses which are due to the wh-in-situ applying to each S node and the normal subj-head rule applying. Unfortunately, the MRS chain connecting the verb with phrasal index starts breaking at the comp-head phrase "zhedrag grangmo yogredbas".

B. Variable property mapping

For MT, we introduced the following changes to VPM. We removed E. from TENSE, ASPECT and MOOD. We removed PNG from PER and NUM.

To improve results for generation and MT, we gave reasonable default types for TENSE, ASPECT and MOOD:

  * >> present
  present << [e]

  * >> no-aspect
  no-aspect << [e]

  * >> indic
  indic << [e]


C. First MT

To translate, we added the relevant vocabulary and tested translation between Tibetan and English. To do this, we added renamed PER values:

PNG.PER : PER
  3rd <> third
  2nd <> second
  1st <> first
  * <> *

We also mapped pl to sg because plural nouns tend to be mapped to sg because they are underspecified in Tibetan:

PNG.NUM : NUM
  pl <> sg
  sg <> sg


D. Grammar improvements

The current grammar includes an obligatory series of case classes on verbs which now make it possible to specify mood and finite FORM as well as nonfinite FORM consistently. 

empty-suffix-rule := aspect-mood-suffix-lex-rule-super & const-lex-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM nonfinite ].

 
With the rules in place, we had to add some rules to prevent the coordination of verbs aux verbs with their complements--we did this by constraining coordination to finite verbs.  

+vp-coord-phrase := event-coord-phrase &
+  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD verb,
+                       VAL.SUBJ < [ ] > ],
+    LCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD verb & [ FORM finite ],
+    RCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD verb & [ FORM finite ]].

+vp-bottom-coord-phrase := bottom-coord-phrase &
+  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD verb,
+                       VAL.SUBJ < [ ] > ],
+    NONCONJ-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD verb & [ FORM finite ],
+                                   VAL.SUBJ < [ ] > ]]



F. Coverage and Overgeneration

		Baseline	Current	
Coverage 	47/83		48/83
Ambiguity	1.81		2.34
Overgeneration	2/31		0/31

One reason that ambiguity has increased is that we now have issues with the wh-in-situ clause firing because mood is underspecified--we have interr specified but that will still unify with the underspecified "mood". With a forthcoming major refactoring of the grammar, we will have an obligatory succession of verb inflection rules which will allow us to take care of the underspecification issues.   
Another way in which ambiguity has increased is that the wh-pronoun seems to optionally go through either of the possessive inflection rules. Ideally, it would behave like nouns and go through the rule obligatorily.

Besides not parsing the sentence due to specifying FORM, we are also not parsing the previously mentioned negative nominalization example.

Since we are parsing at least two more wh-question sentences, this means that a few no longer parse--we have not been able to track them down.


G. Outstanding issues

We have a few issues with our grammar.
