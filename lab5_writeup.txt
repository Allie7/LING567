I & II. Test suite instances and choices for starter grammar

A. Modification 

In order to implement adverbs, we had to add in adj-head-int because they precede verbs, unlike adjectives following nouns. When we parsed a sentence without a modifier, we did not notice any extra applications of the head adj rule.  

B. Refine demonstratives

C. Argument Optionality

D. Beat back ambiguity
