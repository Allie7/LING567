Lab 5 Writeup


A. Modification 

In order to implement adverbs, we had to add in adj-head-int because they precede verbs, unlike adjectives following nouns. When we parsed a sentence without a modifier, we did not notice any extra applications of the head adj rule. However, we noticed the return of issues with the possessions library. We fixed this problem in the same way as it was fixed for head-adj by specifying that the head of the phrase be nonpossessive and marking the phrase itself nonpossessive:

adj-head-int-phrase :+ [ NON-HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD.POSSESSOR nonpossessive,
                                    POSSESSUM nonpossessive ] ].

This fixed the issue we had with this sentence (as before with head-adj):

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: poss
ngas    ngali   nyigdugs        lus     1dug
nga-s   nga-li  nyigdugs        lus     1dug
I-ERG   I-GEN   umbrella        leave   AUX
"I've left my umbrella behind (I remember doing so)"

We checked and compared the MRS for the sentence pair about the black pen which could be attributive or predicative based on the position of the determiner.

Predicative:

Source: d:95
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adj
nyuku   ti      nakpo           re
nyuku   ti      nak-po          re
pen     this    black-NMZ       be
"This pen is black"


Attributive:

Source: d:95
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adj
nyuku   nakpo           ti      re
nyuku   nak-po          ti      re
pen     black-NMZ       this    be
'This is a black pen'

The attributive example, of course, had one more MRS block for the verb situation whereas the predicative example did not.

Because we had feeback that our section on adverbs was thin, we revisited sources to find more examples of adverbs and looked for new ones. Most say that they appear as adjectives. However, source D states that -cha can be added to any adjective to make it an adverb. Source D is a textbook of "standard" Tibetan; the forward states "The Manual of Standard Tibetan emphasizes Modern colloquial Tibetan as spoken in and around Lhasa, but adhering to a register that is widely used and understood" (16). Perhaps this is a pattern outside the Lhasan dialect. 

We did find a second source which explicitly identified nominalized adjectives as adverbs in an example. They note that adverbs can appear between a verb and its CP. Unfortunately, the example is ditransitive, so it will not parse:

#adverb of degree
Source: e:40
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adv
khos    khongtshola     mgoskor         mangpo          btang   pared
kho-s   khong-tsho-la   mgoskor         mang-po         btang   pa-red
3sg-ERG 3sg-PL-DAT      deception       many-NMZ        send    LK-AUX
"He cheated them a lot"

Another example which doesn't parse yet due to intensifiers, but also verifies that the various types adverbs appear to be the same in Tibetan:

#adverb of manner
Source: e:48
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adv
mota    mgyogspo        zhedrags        btang   na      dpe     bsags   yong
mota    mgyogs-po       zhedrags        btang   na      dpe     bsags   yong
cat.ABS fast-NMZ        very            do      if      very    fall    come
"If a vehicle is driven too fast, there will be an accident"

To implement adverbs, we added another type as mentioned in the lab:

adverb-lex := basic-adverb-lex & intersective-mod-lex &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD.MOD < [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD verb ]>,
			   VAL [ SPR < >,
				 SUBJ < >,
				 COMPS < >,
				 SPEC < > ]]]]].

We moved changed some of the words which were previously adjectives into being adverbs:

yagpo := adverb-lex &
  [ STEM < "yagpo" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_well_a_rel" ].

This example parses but now with the proper semantics:

Source: b:209
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adv
khong   bodskad yagpo           mkhyen  gyi1dug
khong   bodskad yag-po          mkhyen  gyi-1dug
He      Tibetan good-NMZ        know    LK-AUX
'He knows Tibetan well'

We added cardinal numbers as subtypes of adjectives to parse another example of coordination:

cardinal-lex := attr-adj-lex.

B. Refine demonstratives

Tibetan has a few demonstrative determiners aside from regular determiners such as "cig"(like the English "a"), among them, "1di/ti"(close to the speaker) and "de" (far from the speaker) appeared in our testsuite:

Source: b:124
Vetted: s
Judgement: g
Phenomena: adj
ja 1di zhimpo yin
ja 1di zhim-po yin
tea this tasty-NMZ  be
"This tea is tasty."

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: det, tam, neg
yige    de    medpa	1dra
yige    de    med-pa	1dra
letter  that  neg-EXIST	AUX 
'That letter does not seem to be here'

We implement the demonstrative determiners by following the instructions in lab5 specifications step by step. We first redefine the determiner super type as the the snippet in the specification, and then define the normal and demonstrative subtype accordingly. 

However, after following step by step to the specification and loading the grammar, we found that we got multiple parses for determiners containing phrases, allowing the determiner to attach to the verb. To constrain this, we added one more supertype for the determiner-lex-supertype:

determiner-lex-supertype := norm-hook-lex-item & basic-zero-arg & non-mod-lex-item.

That fixes the problem.

C. Argument Optionality

When we proposed working on ARG-OPT, We did not consider how much data would be required to implement COG-ST for argument optionality based on verb types. There may be some relationship with the evidentiality and viewpoint system through the AUX verbs, but since we are not modeling those, we gave up on modeling COG-ST of argument optionality.

Our source b did mention that due to the Given/New system, in certain context the subject can be ellipsed. However, it also mentioned that Tibetan used ellipsis to extreme limit, not only the subject and object, even the main verb can be dropped in one case it gives, and leaving only the auxiliary. Another source mentioned that within context such as a conversation, where the hearer and speaker are both clear about the subject and object they refer to, the arguments can be dropped. It also mentioned that the auxiliaries can imply the PERSON value of the subjects and serve as the "second proof" to make the hearer understand what the subject is. But still, our data is very limited on this matter. And to prevent unnecessary ambiguities due to interactions with coordination rules and clausal modifier rules, like we got last week, we decide to put argument optionality aside first.

D. Coordination revisited 

Though source B identifies "dang" as a coordinator (102), it is unlikely that "dang" ("with") is a true coordination based on typology. However, in our implementation we have made this assumption. The only other 3+ coordinated NP's we have encountered so far in the corpus have included the word etc.. which is special in English. Furthermore, a second source explicitly identifies "dang" was a coordinator:

This parses correctly but with ambiguity, in part due to the added cardinal number type we introduced:

Source: e:57
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: crd
bzhedtshal              gnyis   dang    thang           cig     bzos        tshar   payin
bzhedtshal              gnyis   dang    thang.ABS       cig     bzos        tshar   payin
vegetables.HON.ABS      two     and     soup            a       make.PST    finish  PRF
"I have already made two vegetable dishes and a soup"

For the time being, it is thus reasonable to assume that the word is a coordinator. This sentence does not parse due to the assumed order within the monosydentonic coordination pattern:

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: crd, crdagr
mar     dang    phyurba sha     pagspa  1dug
mar     dang    phyurba sha     pagspa  1dug
butter  CRD     cheese  meat    hide    exist
"There are butter, cheese, meats and hides."
 
In order to coordinate the NP, and, NP, NP pattern we had to edit a few things. First, we created a monopoly coordination rule which expects the coordinated itemon the opposite daughter: 

inv-monopoly-top-coord-rule := top-coord-rule &
  [ LCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD +,
    RCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD - ].

inv-monopoly-mid-coord-rule := mid-coord-rule &
  [ LCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD +,
    RCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD - ].

and place it into the mid and top rules:

n1-same-same-same-top-coord-rule := basic-n-top-coord-rule & inv-monopoly-top-coord-rule & same-same-same-case-coord-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD-STRAT "1" ].

n1-same-same-same-mid-coord-rule := basic-n-mid-coord-rule & inv-monopoly-mid-coord-rule & same-same-same-case-coord-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD-STRAT "1" ].


This was enough to coordinate all of the words in the above example from CRD to the end. In order to start the coordination with the first item, we had to change the order of the conjunct and the coordinand to expect it last in the bottom coordination phrase:

n1-bottom-coord-rule := conj-last-bottom-coord-rule & n-bottom-coord-phrase & pass-up-png-coord-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD-STRAT "1" ].

D. Auxiliaries
The Tibetan auxiliaries are used to indicate tense, aspect, modality, view point and evidentiality. Though our source has not explore more on this topic, it shows that the verb-auxiliary pattern can expand to at least zero to three auxiliaries on a single main verb. The sources did not mention specifically on what order the auxiliaries are when they appear together, but according to our observation, there seems to be certain patterns: "yod" > "yin" > "red" / "yogred". The auxiliary with the mood marker appears at the right most. The order of the rest of auxiliaries are unclear, but they either have not appear in series in our source, or appear at the rightmost position.

Source: b:166
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tam, wo, c
khonggis        slobsbyong      gnang	musyin	gired
khong-gis       slobsbyong      gnang	mus-yin	gi-red
She-ERG         study           do	PROS-be	FUT-be
"She's probably at her studies"


Source: b:117
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tam, wo, c
1gro giyod  payin  pa1dra
1gro gi-yod pa-yin pa-1dra
go   FUT-EXIST FUT-be FUT-seem
"So it seems he's going."

(The second example is perfect for illustrating the order of auxiliaries, though unfortunatly we haven't make it parse. but "1gro giyod payin 1dra" parses, which indicates that it is not the problem with the auxiliary stem. We are not sure about the cause of this problem yet.)

We implement this by first turn the requirement of auxiliary complement to be [AUX bool] instead of [AUX - ]:

subj-raise-aux-no-pred := subj-raise-aux & raise-sem-lex-item &
  [ ARG-ST < [ ],
             [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.AUX bool ] > ].
	      
Then we added a few FORM feature types, to constrain the order of auxiliaries. Since the longest expansion we can find is three, we specified 3 form feature types AUX1, AUX2, AUX3 and two inner level types + one main verb types, and specified their corresponding infinite and finite types:

form := *top*.
nonfinite := form.
finite := form.

inner1 := form.
inner2 := inner1.
aux1 := form.
aux3 := inner2.
mv := inner2.
aux2 := inner1.

inner1-fin := inner1 & finite.
inner2-fin := inner2 & inner1-fin.
aux2-fin := inner1-fin & aux2.
aux3-fin := inner2-fin & aux3.
mv-fin := inner2-fin & mv.
aux1-fin := aux1 & finite.

inner1-inf := inner1 & nonfinite.
inner2-inf := inner2 & inner1-inf.
aux2-inf := inner1-inf & aux2.
aux3-inf := inner2-inf & aux3.
mv-inf := inner2-inf & mv.
aux1-inf := aux1 & nonfinite.

Then we specify the FORM feature of the auxiliaries and their complement FORM feature constraints accordingly. The auxiliary that appear at the right most would have [FORM aux1] and complement constraint [FORM inner1-inf], the innermost, such as yod, would have [FORM aux3] and complement constraint [FORM mv-inf], the ones in the middle would have [FORM aux2] and complement constraints [FORM inner2-inf]. The form feature of the main verbs would be [FORM mv]:


red-aux-lex := subj-raise-aux-no-pred &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD.FORM  aux1,
		       VAL.COMPS.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM inner1-inf ]]
		       
yin-aux-lex := subj-raise-aux-no-pred &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD.FORM  aux2,
		       VAL.COMPS.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM inner2-inf ]]

yod-aux-lex := subj-raise-aux-no-pred &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD.FORM  aux3,
		       VAL.COMPS.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM mv-inf ],
		       
The mood-marker-rule would specify the auxiliary it marks to be [FORM finite]:
	
mood-marker-lex-rule-super := add-only-no-ccont-rule & infl-lex-rule &
  [ INFLECTED #infl,
    DTR mood-marker-rule-dtr &
        [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM finite,
	  INFLECTED #infl &
                    [ YIN-AUX-FLAG na ] ] ].

E. Beating Ambiguity

A lot of our ambiguities last week are caused by the interactions between argument optionality and other rules such as coordinationa and clausal modifiers, one sentence was parsed 63 trees because of that. After fixing the libraries and the removal of coordination between auxiliaries, the ambiguities dropped significantly down. The rest of our ambiguities are mainly caused by the homographs of auxiliaries and main verbs, corpular verbs and adjectives and noun coordination. But the overall ambiguities are still reduced significantly. Our greatest amibiguities currently is 11 parses for one sentence, but it has three words with multiple entries and is a complex interactions between coordination and clausal complements. 


F. Coverage and Overgeneration

		Baseline	Current	
Coverage 	42/80		47/80
Ambiguity	3.6		1.8
Overgeneration	1/30		1/30

The coverage has increased thanks in part due to the work on the phenomena this week as well, new phenomena covered and increases in vocabulary. 

Unfortunately, one of our sentences still continues to parse despite our additions of form to the FORM system:

Source: author

Judgment: u

khyedrang       bod-la          phebs-pas       myong-ngas
you             Tibet-DAT       go.HON-Q        experiential-Q
"Have you ever been to Tibet"

G. Test Corpus

We collected a test corpus from the back of source B. We had our choice of a conversation, a narrative style story, and a synthetic conversation for teaching purposes. We chose the first 10 sentences in a conversation which involve questions and the like. We may add more examples from another format if this proves too difficult.
