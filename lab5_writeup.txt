A. Modification 

In order to implement adverbs, we had to add in adj-head-int because they precede verbs, unlike adjectives following nouns. When we parsed a sentence without a modifier, we did not notice any extra applications of the head adj rule. However, we noticed the return of issues with the possessions library. We fixed this problem in the same way as it was fixed for head-adj by specifying that the head of the phrase be nonpossessive and marking the phrase itself nonpossessive:

adj-head-int-phrase :+ [ NON-HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD.POSSESSOR nonpossessive,
                                    POSSESSUM nonpossessive ] ].

This fixed the issue we had with this sentence (as before with head-adj):

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: poss
ngas    ngali   nyigdugs        lus     1dug
nga-s   nga-li  nyigdugs        lus     1dug
I-ERG   I-GEN   umbrella        leave   AUX
"I've left my umbrella behind (I remember doing so)"

I checked and compared the MRS for the sentence pair about the black pen which could be attributive or predicative based on the position of the determiner.

Predicative:

Source: d:95
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adj
nyuku   ti      nakpo           re
nyuku   ti      nak-po          re
pen     this    black-NMZ       be
"This pen is black"


Attributive:

Source: d:95
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adj
nyuku   nakpo           ti      re
nyuku   nak-po          ti      re
pen     black-NMZ       this    be
'This is a black pen'

The attributive example, of course, had one more MRS block for the verb situation whereas the predicative example did not.


Because we had feeback that our section on adverbs was thin, I revisited sources to find more examples of adverbs and looked for new ones. Most say that they appear as adjectives. However, source D states that -cha can be added to any adjective to make it an adverb. Source D is a textbook of "standard" Tibetan; the forward states "The Manual of Standard Tibetan emphasizes Modern colloquial Tibetan as spoken in and around Lhasa, but adhering to a register that is widely used and understood" (16). Perhaps this is a pattern outside the Lhasan dialect. 

We did find a second source which explicitly identified nominalized adjectives as adverbs in an example. They note that adverbs can appear between a verb and its CP. Unfortunately, the example is ditransitive, so it will not parse:

#adverb of degree
Source: e:40
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adv
khos    khongtshola     mgoskor         mangpo          btang   pared
kho-s   khong-tsho-la   mgoskor         mang-po         btang   pa-red
3sg-ERG 3sg-PL-DAT      deception       many-NMZ        send    LK-AUX
"He cheated them a lot"

Another example which doesn't parse yet due to intensifiers, but also verifies that the various types adverbs appear to be the same in Tibetan:

#adverb of manner
Source: e:48
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adv
mota    mgyogspo        zhedrags        btang   na      dpe     bsags   yong
mota    mgyogs-po       zhedrags        btang   na      dpe     bsags   yong
cat.ABS fast-NMZ        very            do      if      very    fall    come
"If a vehicle is driven too fast, there will be an accident"

To implement this, we added another type as mentioned in the lab:

adverb-lex := basic-adverb-lex & intersective-mod-lex &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD.MOD < [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD verb ]>,
			   VAL [ SPR < >,
				 SUBJ < >,
				 COMPS < >,
				 SPEC < > ]]]]].

We moved changed some of the words which were previously adjectives into being adverbs:

yagpo := adverb-lex &
  [ STEM < "yagpo" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_well_a_rel" ].

This example parses but now with the proper semantics:

Source: b:209
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adv
khong   bodskad yagpo           mkhyen  gyi1dug
khong   bodskad yag-po          mkhyen  gyi-1dug
He      Tibetan good-NMZ        know    LK-AUX
'He knows Tibetan well'

B. Refine demonstratives

C. Argument Optionality

In our sources, we have found no mention of systematic rules for argument optionality. However, based on the meaning of the sentences such as negation and translation, we can see that some of them have likely have certain constraints. 

# type-id
Source: b:116
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, neg, pro-d
maphyin         paredda
ma-phyin        pa-red-da
not-went        LK-AUX-EMPH
'Certainly he didn't go.'

#focus

Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, neg, tam, pro-d
khonggis   magnang  pared
khong-gis  ma-gnang pa-red

"He didn't give it.

#subject
Source: b:160
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: poss, pro-d
ngali   nyigdugs        lus     1dug
nga-li  nyigdugs        lus     1dug
I-GEN   umbrella        leave   AUX
"I've left my umbrella behind (I remember doing so)"

D. Coordination revisited 

Though source B identifies "dang" as a coordinator (102), it is unlikely that "dang" ("with") is a true coordination based on typology. However, in our implementation we have made this assumption. The only other 3+ coordinated NP's we have encountered so far in the corpus have included the word etc.. which is special in English. Furthermore, a second source explicitly identifies "dang" was a coordinator:

This example doesn't parse yet:

Source: e:57
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: crd
bzhedtshal              gnyis   dang    thang           cig     bzos    tshar   payin
bzhedtshal              gnyis   dang    thang.ABS       cig     bzos    tshar   payin
vegetables.HON.ABS      two     and     soup            a       make    finish  PRF
"I have already made two vegetable dishes and a soup"
 
For the time being, it is thus reasonable to assume that the word is a coordinator. This sentence does not parse due to the assumed order within the monosydentonic coordination pattern:

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: crd, crdagr
mar     dang    phyurba sha     pagspa  1dug
mar     dang    phyurba sha     pagspa  1dug
butter  CRD     cheese  meat    hide    exist
"There are butter, cheese, meats and hides."
 
In order to coordinate the NP, and, NP, NP pattern we had to edit a few things. First, we created a monopoly coordination rule which expects the coordinated itemon the opposite daughter: 

inv-monopoly-top-coord-rule := top-coord-rule &
  [ LCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD +,
    RCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD - ].

inv-monopoly-mid-coord-rule := mid-coord-rule &
  [ LCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD +,
    RCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD - ].

and place it into the mid and top rules:

n1-same-same-same-top-coord-rule := basic-n-top-coord-rule & inv-monopoly-top-coord-rule & same-same-same-case-coord-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD-STRAT "1" ].

n1-same-same-same-mid-coord-rule := basic-n-mid-coord-rule & inv-monopoly-mid-coord-rule & same-same-same-case-coord-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD-STRAT "1" ].


This was enough to coordinate all of the words in the above example from CRD to the end. In order to start the coordination with the first item, we had to change the order of the conjunct and the coordinand to expect it last in the bottom coordination phrase:

n1-bottom-coord-rule := conj-last-bottom-coord-rule & n-bottom-coord-phrase & pass-up-png-coord-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD-STRAT "1" ].

D. Beat back ambiguity
