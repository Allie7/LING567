B. Agreement

C&D. Coordination & Agreement in coordinated NPs

By searching through the realworld text at the end of the source B, we found examples of NP coordination and so-called "weak" VP coordination.
Because the examples were complex, we started working with simplified ones but also kept the originals.

NPs are coordinated by the word "dang" which means roughtly "with" under the monosyndeton paradigm. This coordinating particle falls between the first NP and the rest.

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: crd, crdagr
ngas    lcogtse dang    rkubkyag        thsong  giyin
nga-s   lcogtse dang    rkubkyag        thsong  gi-yin
I-ERG   table   CRD     chair           sell    LK-AUX
"I shall sell the tables and chairs"

According to source B, the coordinated NPs must all be the subject or object of the verb; hence, this example should fail to parse:

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: crdagr
ngas    lcogtses        dang    rkubkyag        thsong  giyin
nga-s   lcogtse-s       dang    rkubkyag        thsong  gi-yin
I-ERG   table-ERG       CRD     chair           sell    LK-AUX
"I shall sell the tables and chairs"

By contrast, VP coordination involves joining clauses without a coordinating word:

Source: b:220
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: crd, crdagr
zhoggas ngatshos        yige    bris    denas   khalag  bzas    denas   chamchamla      phyin   payin
zhoggas nga-tsho-s      yige    bris    denas   khalag  bzas    denas   chamcham-la     phyin   pa-yin
morning I-num-ERG       letter  write   then    meal    ate     then    walk-DAT        went    LK-AUX
"In the morning we wrote letters, then we had a meal, then we went for a walk"

One may think that denas coordinates the VPs, but there was an example from real text without it:

Source: b:277
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: crd, crdagr
grogspo mi      dila            yar     khorangla       skyeddman       yogred  bugu    yogred
grogspo mi      di-la           yar     khorang-la      skyeddman       yogred  bugu    yogred
friend  man     this-DAT        top.    he-DAT          wife            exist   child   exist
'The friend had a wife and child'

Because we don't have adjuncts, we made a simpler version:

#simplified VP  coordination
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: crd, crdagr
ngatshos        yige    bris    khalag  bzas
nga-tsho-s      yige    bris    khalag  bzas
I-num-ERG       letter  write   meal    ate
"We wrote letters and ate a meal"

And a corresponding incorrectly coordinated example; we know that dang can only be used with verbs which have been nominalized:

#simplified VP  coordination
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: crd
ngatshos        yige    bris	dang    khalag  bzas
nga-tsho-s      yige    bris    dang	khalag  bzas
I-num-ERG       letter  write   and	meal    ate
"We wrote letters and ate a meal"

Choices: To implement this, we chose the monosyndeton coordination pattern for NPs and nouns and selected "dang" as the coordinating word. We also created a feature resolution pattern for nouns, noun_res, which states that they have to match in case.  For verbs we selected the asydenton pattern without any other specifications.  

E. Attributive Adjectives

In Tibetan, there are adjectival verbs rather than adjectives; to become attributive, they undergo nominalization:

#Derived
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adj
mi      mangpo          cig     1dug
mi      mang-po         cig     1dug
person  many-nom        num     exist
"There are a many people"

The adjective must be to the right of the noun phrase

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: adj
mangpo          mi              cig     1dug
mang-po         mi              cig     1dug
many-nom        people  num     exist
"There are a many people


Although this is out of scope, we did include several examples of
predicational use of adjectives; source D notes that the attributional
and predicative use of verbs are nearly identical; without the determiner
in its position, both of these sentences would mean the same thing:

Source: d:95
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adj
nyuku   ti      nakpo           re
nyuku   ti      nak-po          re
pen     this    black-nom       be
"This pen is black"

Source: d:95
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adj
nyuku   nakpo           ti      re
nyuku   nak-po          ti      re
pen     black-nom       this    be
'This is a black pen'


Choices: To implement this, we had to pretend that Tibetan had adjectives. We specified that the nominalized
adjectival verbs were both attributive and predicative based on the example above. We specified that adjectives
modify the items before them. Finally we said that adjectives impossibly appear as the complement of a copula 
because stating optionally seemed to require a morphological rule and predicative adjectives are out of scope.

F. Adverbs

Adverbs also appear as nominalized adjectival verbs:

Source: b:209
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adv
khong   bodskad yagpo           mkhyen  gyi1dug
khong   bodskad yag-po          mkhyen  gyi-1dug
He      Tibetan good-nom        know    LK-AUX
'He knows Tibetan well'


Choices: we have made no choices for this yet

G. Tense/Aspect

Morphology:

Choices:

H. Sentential Negation

III. Testsuite instances not yet covered

We do not parse any of the testsuite instances dealing with:
* Wh-Questions
* Aspect & Tense
* Auxiliary verbs  
* Adjunct phrases (instrumental verbs)

IV. Coverage and Overgeneration


V. Outside domain of customization

We were not able to model adverbs and adjectives as the verbs they truly are based on the customization system.
