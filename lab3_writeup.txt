Lab3 writeup

We have added coordination, negation, attributed adjectives in our test suite:	
	
	a. Negation

	In Tibetan, negation is generally marked on the auxiliary verbs with the prefixes mi- or ma-. Lexical verbs can be marked too as a minority pattern. Each auxiliary verb has specific requirements on which prefix it can be added to.

	There’s obligatory contraction for certain auxiliary verbs, namely “yin”, “yod”, and “yogred”. When negated, “yin” became “man”, “yod” became “med”, “yogred” became “yogmared”.

"I didn't give.”

Choices: Since Tibetan has three polarity types, though we are only required to do negation for lab3, we created a general polarity-marker inflection type in the morphology page. Under it we created a polarity-marker super type that has negation feature specified on the verb, and then we created two separate subtypes for “mi” and “ma”. 
for the non-contracted forms, since each auxiliary verb stem has requirement on which affix can be added(not only for negation-marking, but for all inflections), we decide to give each auxiliary verb stem an independent entry. for each verb, we specify the morphological constraints to forbid it to undergo the morphology rule type that adds the wrong affix to it.
for “yin”, “yod” and “yogred”, we forbid the whole negation marking rule super type, and create separate lexicon types for their negated forms. for the negated forms, we specify their predicate to be “neg_rel”, and forbid the whole polarity marker inflection. 


B. Coordination & Agreement in coordinated NPs

By searching through the realworld text at the end of the source B, we found examples of NP coordination and so-called "weak" VP coordination.
Because the examples were complex, we started working with simplified ones but also kept the originals.

NPs are coordinated by the word "dang" which means roughtly "with" under the monosyndeton paradigm. This coordinating particle falls between the first NP and the rest.

Phenomena: crd, crdagr
ngas    lcogtse dang    rkubkyag        thsong  giyin
nga-s   lcogtse dang    rkubkyag        thsong  gi-yin
I-ERG   table   CRD     chair           sell    LK-AUX
"I shall sell the tables and chairs"

According to source B, the coordinated NPs must all be the subject or object of the verb; hence, this example should fail to parse:

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: crdagr
ngas    lcogtses        dang    rkubkyag        thsong  giyin
nga-s   lcogtse-s       dang    rkubkyag        thsong  gi-yin
I-ERG   table-ERG       CRD     chair           sell    LK-AUX
"I shall sell the tables and chairs"

By contrast, VP coordination involves joining clauses without a coordinating word:

Source: b:220
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: crd, crdagr
zhoggas ngatshos        yige    bris    denas   khalag  bzas    denas   chamchamla      phyin   payin
zhoggas nga-tsho-s      yige    bris    denas   khalag  bzas    denas   chamcham-la     phyin   pa-yin
morning I-num-ERG       letter  write   then    meal    ate     then    walk-DAT        went    LK-AUX
"In the morning we wrote letters, then we had a meal, then we went for a walk"

One may think that denas coordinates the VPs, but there was an example from real text without it:

Source: b:277
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: crd, crdagr
grogspo mi      dila            yar     khorangla       skyeddman       yogred  bugu    yogred
grogspo mi      di-la           yar     khorang-la      skyeddman       yogred  bugu    yogred
friend  man     this-DAT        top.    he-DAT          wife            exist   child   exist
'The friend had a wife and child'

Because we don't have adjuncts, we made a simpler version:

#simplified VP  coordination

Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: crd, crdagr
ngatshos        yige    bris    khalag  bzas
nga-tsho-s      yige    bris    khalag  bzas
I-num-ERG       letter  write   meal    ate
"We wrote letters and ate a meal"

And a corresponding incorrectly coordinated example; we know that dang can only be used with verbs which have been nominalized:

#simplified VP  coordination
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: crd
ngatshos        yige    bris	dang    khalag  bzas
nga-tsho-s      yige    bris    dang	khalag  bzas
I-num-ERG       letter  write   and	meal    ate
"We wrote letters and ate a meal"

Choices: To implement this, we chose the monosyndeton coordination pattern for NPs and nouns and selected "dang" as the coordinating word. We also created a feature resolution pattern for nouns, noun_res, which states that they have to match in case.  For verbs we selected the asydenton pattern without any other specifications.  

E. Attributive Adjectives

In Tibetan, there are adjectival verbs rather than adjectives; to become attributive, they undergo nominalization:

#Derived
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adj
mi      mangpo          cig     1dug
mi      mang-po         cig     1dug
person  many-nom        num     exist
"There are a many people"

The adjective must be to the right of the noun phrase

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: adj
mangpo          mi              cig     1dug
mang-po         mi              cig     1dug
many-nom        people  num     exist
"There are a many people


Although this is out of scope, we did include several examples of
predicational use of adjectives; source D notes that the attributional
and predicative use of verbs are nearly identical; without the determiner
in its position, both of these sentences would mean the same thing:

Source: d:95
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adj
nyuku   ti      nakpo           re
nyuku   ti      nak-po          re
pen     this    black-nom       be
"This pen is black"

Source: d:95
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adj
nyuku   nakpo           ti      re
nyuku   nak-po          ti      re
pen     black-nom       this    be
'This is a black pen'

Choices: To implement this, we had to pretend that Tibetan had adjectives. We specified that the nominalized
adjectival verbs were both attributive and predicative based on the example above. We specified that adjectives
modify the items before them. Finally we said that adjectives impossibly appear as the complement of a copula 
because stating optionally seemed to require a morphological rule and predicative adjectives are out of scope.

F. Adverbs

Adverbs also appear as nominalized adjectival verbs:

Source: b:209
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adv
khong   bodskad yagpo           mkhyen  gyi1dug
khong   bodskad yag-po          mkhyen  gyi-1dug
He      Tibetan good-nom        know    LK-AUX
'He knows Tibetan well'


Choices: we have made no choices for this yet


A. Negation, see part 1.
      B. Tense
	In Tibetan, tense is indicated by a combination of the auxiliary verb(negated or not) and a prefix. The auxiliaries “song”, “yong” and “byung” already carry tense information by themselves, thus do not allow additional affixes.
	
#Example1 for tense

Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c, tam
nga     1si byung
nga     1si-byung

Judgment: u
Phenomena: wo, c, tam
nga     1si pa-byung
nga     1si pa-byung
I       die PAST-PAST
'I have died.’
Choices: Specify the tense feature in their lexicon type.

	The auxiliaries “yin”, “yod”, “red”, “1dug” and “yogred” combine with particular prefixes to indicate tense. different combinations will have different indications. For example, “pa+yin” indicates Past Tense, “gi+yin” indicates Future Tense, “gi+yod” indicates Present Tense and “pa+yod” indicates Future Tense. The prefixes are: gi-, gyi-, kyi-, pa-, ba-, ga-, nga- and ra-


#past tense

Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c, tam
ngas  yige    klog bayin
nga-s  yige    klog ba-yin
1ST-ERG letter  read LK-AUX
'I read the letter.'


Choices: We first added lexical rule types for each tense and specify the tense on the verb, for Future Tense which have two different affixes as markers, we construct two subtypes. Then under the lexicon type for each auxiliary, we specify the morphological constraints to forbid the auxiliary to undergo certain rules.


          Aspect
	Tibetan has four aspects, Perfect, Recent, Progressive and Prospective. The simple perfect aspect is indicated by either the auxiliary verbs or adding the affixes. The simple perfect form takes suffixes as markers and the rest uses prefixes.

#
#Space for the examples
#

Choices: We create two inflection types for aspect, one for suffixes and one for prefixes. For the auxiliary verbs that indicates aspect by themselves, specify the tense feature in their lexicon type.


      C. Noun Inflections
	1. case marker
	2. plurals for pronoun
	3. self-marking
      *D. Mood markers. 
	Tibetan mood markers are affixes (prefix or suffix, depending on the mood value) attached to the auxiliary verbs. Though lab3 doesn’t require us to do mood, many of the examples we can find for our test suite include this phenomenon. In order to get those examples parsed, we added two temporary mood-marker rule to allow the mood-marking suffixes to attach to the verbs.

Coverage & others:

unsolved problems:

Outside domain of customization system:

We were not able to model adverbs and adjectives as the verbs they truly are based on the customization system.

We were not able to implement coordination with the monosydeton paradigm for A, AND, B, C, but our analysis may change.
