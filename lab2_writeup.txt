Lab 2 Writeup

There is tone in Tibetan, so we have included the following as markers for high and low tones: ' and `. Also, we have adopted _ as a means of joining together particles and long phrases from grammatical examples which we can't parse yet such as "about fiteeen people."

I & II. Test suite instances and choices

A. Word Order

(Lhasa) Tibetan is an ergative-absolutive SOV language. For intranstivie verbs, the subject is absolutive. For transitive verbs, the agent/subject of transitive verbs is ergative and the object is absolutive. We have illustrated all of the basic word orders. Here is one positive, SOV,  and one negative SVO:

Example #1
Source: a:132
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c,
ngas    stag    bsadpayin
nga-s   stag    bsad-pa-yin
I-SBJ   tiger   killed-LK-AUX
'I killed the tiger.'

Example #2
#SVO
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: wo, c,
ngas    bsadpayin       stag
nga-s   bsad-pa-yin     stag
I-SBJ   killed-LK-AUX   tiger
'I killed the tiger.'

According to source B, auxiliary verbs are particles. They follow the verb.

Source: b:178
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: pn, wo
nga 'grodgosred
nga 'gro-dgos-red
I   go-LK-AUX
'I  must go.'

Multiple auxiliary verbs can follow the verb, so it may be best to analyze them as discrete words:

Source: b:166
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tam, wo
khonggis        slobsbyong      gnangmusyingired
khong-gis       slobsbyong      gnang-mus-yin-gi-red
She-ERG         study           do-LK-AUX-LK-AUX
"She's probably at her studies"

Choices: To implement this, we selected the SOV word order and ergative-absolutive paradigm under case. These two vhoices together along with the lexicon and morphology are what distinguish these sentences as grammatical and ungrammatical. We definied "transitive-verb-lex" which accepts an ergative subject and absolutive object and "perfective-intransitive-verb" which accepts absolutive agents. For auxiliary verbs, we have specified that they should follow the verb, but we haven't been able to include them yet.

B. Case

(Lhasa) Tibetan has a range of 4-6 cases depending on the analysis because some wordforms cover multiple domains; due to their similarity DeLancey (Source C) refers to them as post-clitics

a. Ergative-instrumental: gis,gyis,kyis, -s after a vowel
b. Absolutitive: " "
c. Dative-Locative: la
d. Ablative:  nas/na
e. Genitive: gi/gyi/kyi

Unmarked items fall into the absolutitive case and ergative cases can be marked with -s as in "Example #1". Here are two examples showing that most transitive verbs take the absolutitive as their object, ditranstive verbs and verbs such as hit take the dative as their argument. 

Example #3
Source: c:274
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c
thubbstangyis   blobzangla      gzhus_song
thubbstan-gyis  blobzang-la     gzhus_song
Thubten-ERG     Lobsang-DAT     hit_PRF
'Thubten hit Lobsang'

Example #4
Source: c:274
Vetted: s
Judgment: u
Phenomena: wo, c
thubbstangyis  blobzangla     bsadpared
thubbstan-gyis  blobzang-la   bsad-pa-red
Thubten-ERG     Lobsang-DAT   kill_PRF
'Thubten killed Lobsang'

Example #5
Source: b:215
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: c
ngas     khola     yige     btanggiyin
nga-s    kho-la    yige     btang-gi-yin
1SG-ERG  3SG-DAT   letter   send-LK-AUX
'I will send him a letter."

Although the ergative and instrumental cases fall into the same bucket under DeLancey's analysis; The instrumental case can appear alongside an item in the ergative case:

Example #6
Source: b:203
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c
khos            yige            smyug_gus       bris_song
kho-s           yige            smyug-gus       bris_song
3sg-ERG         letter          pen-INST        wrote_aux
‘He wrote the letter with a pen.’


Choices: For our first grammar, we had to decide whether to make case part of all the different lexicon entries which would become cumbersome, make them clitics and/or morphological rules. Attempts were made to implement the various forms as clitics, but at this point it was decided to use morphological rules because the nouns in our examples have been simple--this may change, but it appears we can only have one case per adposition. We may use morphological rules to operate on adpositions though.

C. Pronouns

There are pronouns for I, you and he/she in Tibetan. They do not have to agree with the verb in terms of number or gender, so it is nearly impossible to come up with ungrammatical examples at this point. We have illustrations of "I", "you", "he", and "she" as follows: 

#Example 7
Source: b:178
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: pn, wo
nga 'grodgosred
nga 'gro-dgos-red
I   go-LK-AUX
'I  must go.'

There's also an optional affix '-rang', which means "self" for pronouns. such as:

nga               ngarang
1st-SG            1st-SG  

The plural forms of the pronouns add '-tsho' to the singular forms, such as:

nga               ngatsho
1ST-SG            1ST-PL

khorang               khorangtsho
3RD-masculine-SG  3RD-masculine-PL

it should be noted that for the 3rd person feminine plurals the '-rang' morpheme is not optional: 'morangtsho'. Also, Tibetan has distinct honorific/ordinary forms for pronouns. And though we decided not to take honorific forms into account, the honorific form of 3rd person pronouns "khong", which means "he" or "she", appears very frequently in the examples we find.


 
Choices: 
To implement pronouns we just had to add them to our lexicon. At first we added them as distinct types, but it may be possible to collapse them into a single noun type since they aren't marked for agreement. We add them according to their person, gender and number features.

D. Rest of NP

In source b, "determinants" are often refered to as noun particles. "cig" is one of the forms which contributes to the specificity of the noun it is joined with. They are not obligatory as illustrated in the following two examples:

Example #8
Source: d:100
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c,
`mi__bculngatsam cig yogred
`mi__bculngatsam cig yogred
PeopleFiteenAbout num exist
'There are about fiteeen people.'

Example #9
Source: d:100
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c,
`mi__bculngatsam  yogred
`mi__bculngatsam  yogred
PeopleFiteenAbout exist
'There are about fiteeen people.'

We have one synthetic ungrammatical example based on the description of noun particles appearing to the right of the noun.

#assumed ungrammatical 
#with the information about particle order
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: wo, c,
cig `mi__bculngatsam yogred
cig `mi__bculngatsam yogred
num PeopleFiteenAbout exist
'There are about fiteeen people.'

Choices: 

The simplest option was to include determiners as descrete words. Depending on challenges, the determinants may become more morphological.

E. Tense/Aspect

Tense is realized in the stem of the verbs. iAccording to source b, there are 3 tenses in Tibetan:
a. present
b. past
c. future

We have one example of each tense such as this one. Unfortunately our examples include linking and auxiliary verbs which make them hard to parse. 

Example #8
#present tense
Source: b:137
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tam
ngas  yige    cig briskyiyod
ngas  yige    cig bris-kyi-yod
1ST-SBJ letter  num write-LK-AUX
'I am writing a letter.'

For aspect, there are:
a. several perfect markers with some slight differences in meaning

Source: a:132
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c,
nga     'si_byung
nga     'si_byung
I       die_PRF
'I have died.'

b. recent aspect: reference time immediately follows event time 

Source: a:161
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c
nga     blebs-gro-yin
I       arrive-LK-AUX
'I had just arrived'

c. (Prospective) gerunditive aspect: intended or desireable with respect to reference time but not completed

Source: a:162
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c
nga     nyocha          nyo-rygu-in
I       shopping        buy-LK-AUX
'I have still to do the shopping'

Others include:
d. imminent aspect
e. preparative aspect
f. premeditated aspect


Choices: we have not yet made choices with respect to these yet.

F. Wh-questions

For questions, there are interrogative noun such as "su." They undergo inflection which seems to obviate the need for them to appear in situ; example #13 shows the subject in OSV order. It appears that Wh questions appear in the middle of the sentence, but it is not clear from the documentation that this happens.

Example #12
Source: b:130
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: c,
khongla rogspa    su  yogredpa
khongla rogspa    su  yogredpa
3SG-LOC many-NOM  who exist-wh.interr
'Who was with him?'

Example #13
Source: b:198
Vetted: s
Judgement:g
chalag  digyad sus tshong_pa_red_pa
chalag  di-gyad         sus     tshong_pa_red_pa
thing   this-num        who-ERG sell_link_aux_interr
'Who sold the things?'


Choices: 

We have not yet included negative examples or made choices with respsect to these yet.

III. Testsuite instances not yet covered

We do not parse any of the testsuite instances dealing with:
* Wh-Questions
* Aspect & Tense
* Auxiliary verbs  
* Adjunct phrases (instrumental verbs)

IV. Coverage and Overgeneration

As of 12:00 on 2018-01-18, the numbers for our 45 items are as follows:

A. Coverage: 14 / 30 positive instances (47%)
B. Overgeneration: 0 / 15 (0%)

For the 16 items in positive examples, we are missing tokens in our lexicon. 4 of the items dealing with pronouns do not parse because they use of auxiliary verbs such as:

Source: b:178
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: pn, wo
nga 'gro dgosred
nga 'gro-dgos_red
I   go-LK_AUX
'I  must go.'

The next group which does not parse includes auxiliary verbs which illustrate the tenses such as this:

#FUTURE TENSE
Source: b:137
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c, tam
sangnyin  ngas    laska  'di   byedkyiyin
sangnyin  nga-s    laska  'di   byed-kyi-yin
tomorrow  1ST-SBJ  work   this  do-LK-AUX
'He is sure to do the work.'

The final major group are questions which include question words

Source: b:130
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: c,
kyedrang   su    yin-pa
kyedrang   su    yin-pa
2ND         who   be-wh.interr
'Who are you?'

There were no incorrectly parsed sentences.

V. Outside domain of customization

One area where the customization system had challenges was creating multiple adopositions as clitics marking case. When we added two adpositions marking the same case, the system failed to parse either. Since we have simple exampels of nouns so far, we have used morphological rules.

Another issue we have had, is that auxiliary verbs do not seem to be created with orthographic strings even when the stem is specified. 

Another issue is that it seems we cannot yet describe ditransitive verbs because there are only slots for subj and object. This is out of the scope of the class I gather.
