Lab 2 Writeup


There is tone in Tibetan, so we have included the following as markers for high and low tones: ' and `. Also, we have adopted _ as a means of joining together particles and long phrases from grammatical examples which we can't parse yet such as "about fiteeen people."

I & II. Test suite instances and choices

A. Word Order

(Lhasa) Tibetan is an ergative-absolutive SOV language. For intranstivie verbs, the subject is absolutive. For transitive verbs, the agent/subject of transitive verbs is ergative and the object is absolutive. We have illustrated all of the basic word orders. Here is one positive, SOV,  and one negative SVO:

Example #1
Source: a:132
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c,
ngas    stag    bsadpayin
nga-s   stag    bsad-pa-yin
I-SBJ   tiger   killed-LK-AUX
'I killed the tiger.'

Example #2
#SVO
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: wo, c,
ngas    bsadpayin       stag
nga-s   bsad-pa-yin     stag
I-SBJ   killed-LK-AUX   tiger
'I killed the tiger.'


According to source B, auxiliary verbs are particles. They follow the verb.

Source: b:178
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: pn, wo
nga 'grodgosred
nga 'gro-dgos-red
I   go-LK-AUX
'I  must go.'

Choices: To implement this, we selected the SOV word order and ergative-absolutive paradigm under case. These two vhoices together along with the lexicon and morphology are what distinguish these sentences as grammatical and ungrammatical.

B. Case

(Lhasa) Tibetan has a range of 4-6 cases depending on the analysis because some wordforms cover multiple domains; due to their similarity DeLancey (Source C) refers to them as post-clitics

a. Ergative-instrumental: gis,gyis,kyis, -s after a vowel
b. Absolutitive: " "
c. Dative-Locative: la
d. Ablative:  nas/na
e. Genitive: gi/gyi/kyi

Unmarked items fall into the absolutitive case and ergative cases can be marked with -s as in "Example #1". Here are two examples showing that most transitive verbs take the absolutitive as their object, verbs such as hit take the dative as their argument

Example #3
Source: c:274
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c
thubbstangyis   blobzangla      gzhus_song
thubbstan-gyis  blobzang-la     gzhus_song
Thubten-ERG     Lobsang-DAT     hit_PRF
'Thubten hit Lobsang'

Example #4
Source: c:274
Vetted: s
Judgment: u
Phenomena: wo, c
thubbstangyis  blobzangla     bsadpared
thubbstan-gyis  blobzang-la   bsad-pa-red
Thubten-ERG     Lobsang-DAT   kill_PRF
'Thubten killed Lobsang'


Although the ergative and instrumental cases fall into the same bucket under DeLancey's analysis; The instrumental case can appear alongside an item in the ergative case:

Example #5
Source: b:203
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c
khos            yige            smyug_gus       bris_song
kho-s           yige            smyug-gus       bris_song
3sg-ERG         letter          pen-INST        wrote_aux
‘He wrote the letter with a pen.’


Choices: For our first grammar, we had to decide whether to make case part of all the different lexicon entries which would become cumbersome, make them clitics and/or morphological rules. Attempts were made to implement the various forms as clitics, but at this point it was decided to use morphological rules because the nouns in our examples have been simple--this may change, but it appears we can only have one case per clitic. We may use morphological rules to operate on clitics though.

C. Pronouns

There are pronouns for I, you and he/she in Tibetan. They do not have to agree with the verb in terms of number or gender, so it is nearly impossible to come up with ungrammatical examples at this point. We have illustrations of "I", "you", "he", and "she" as follows: 

Source: b:178
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: pn, wo
nga 'grodgosred
nga 'gro-dgos-red
I   go-LK-AUX
'I  must go.'
 
Choices: 
To implement pronouns we just had to add them to our lexicon. At first we added them as distinct types, but it may be possible to collapse them into a single noun type since they aren't marked for agreement.  


D. Rest of NP

In source b, "determinants" are often refered to as noun particles. "cig" is one of the forms which contributes to the specificity of the noun it is joined with. They are not obligatory as illustrated in the following two examples:

Example #6
Source: d:100
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c,
`mi__bculngatsam cig yogred
`mi__bculngatsam cig yogred
PeopleFiteenAbout num exist
'There are about fiteeen people.'

Example #7
Source: d:100
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c,
`mi__bculngatsam  yogred
`mi__bculngatsam  yogred
PeopleFiteenAbout exist
'There are about fiteeen people.'

We have one synthetic ungrammatical example based on the description of noun particles appearing to the right of the noun.

#assumed ungrammatical 
#with the information about particle order
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: wo, c,
cig `mi__bculngatsam yogred
cig `mi__bculngatsam yogred
num PeopleFiteenAbout exist
'There are about fiteeen people.'

Choices: 

The simplest option was to include determiners as descrete words. Depending on challenges, the determinants may become more morphological.

E. Tense/Aspect

Tense is realized in the stem of the verbs. iAccording to source b, there are 3 tenses in Tibetan:
a. present
b. past
c. future

We have one example of each tense such as this one. Unfortunately our examples include linking and auxiliary verbs.

Example #8
#present tense
Source: b:137
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tam
ngas  yige    cig briskyiyod
ngas  yige    cig bris-kyi-yod
1ST-SBJ letter  num write-LK-AUX
'I am writing a letter.'

For aspect, there are:
a. several perfect markers with some slight differences in meaning

Source: a:132
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c,
nga     'si_byung
nga     'si_byung
I       die_PRF
'I have died.'

b. recent aspect: reference time immediately follows event time 

Source: a:161
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c
nga     blebs-gro-yin
I       arrive-LK-AUX
'I had just arrived'

c. (Prospective) gerunditive aspect: intended or desireable with respect to reference time but not completed

Source: a:162
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c
nga     nyocha          nyo-rygu-in
I       shopping        buy-LK-AUX
'I have still to do the shopping'

Others include:
d. imminent aspect
e. preparative aspect
f. premeditated aspect

Choices: we have not yet made choices with respect to these yet.

F. Wh-questions

For questions, there are interrogative noun such as "su." They undergo inflection which seems to obviate the need for them to appear in situ; example #13 shows the subject in OSV order. It appears that Wh questions appear in the middle of the sentence, but it is not clear from the documentation that this happens.

Example #12
Source: b:130
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: c,
khongla rogspa    su  yogredpa
khongla rogspa    su  yogredpa
3SG-LOC many-NOM  who exist-wh.interr
'Who was with him?'

Example #13
Source: b:198
Vetted: s
Judgement:g
chalag  digyad sus tshong_pa_red_pa
chalag  di-gyad         sus     tshong_pa_red_pa
thing   this-num        who-ERG sell_link_aux_interr
'Who sold the things?'


Choices: 

We have not yet included negative examples or made choices with respsect to these yet.

III. Testsuite instances not yet covered

We do not parse any of the testsuite instances dealing with:
* Questions
* Aspect & Tense
* Auxiliary verbs

IV. Coverage and Overgeneration

V. Outside domain of customization

Both of the scholars who we have read, DeLancey and Denwood, both claim that sometimes the ergative marking on a subject indicates that they volunatarily performed the action. Others have analyzed it as a more complicated verb hierarchy.
