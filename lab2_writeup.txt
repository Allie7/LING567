There is tone in Tibetan, so we have included the following as markers for high and low tones: ' and `. Later, we should pick more distinct symbols.

I & II. Test suite instances and choices

A. Word Order

(Lhasa) Tibetan is an ergative-absolutive SOV language. For intranstivie verbs, the subject is absolutive. For transitive verbs, the agent/subject of transitive verbs is ergative and the object is absolutive. We have illustrated all of the basic word orders. Here is one positive, SOV,  and one negative SVO:

Example #1
Source: a:132
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c,
ngas    stag    bsadpayin
nga-s   stag    bsad-pa-yin
I-SBJ   tiger   killed-LK-AUX
'I killed the tiger.'

Example #2
#SVO
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: wo, c,
ngas    bsadpayin       stag
nga-s   bsad-pa-yin     stag
I-SBJ   killed-LK-AUX   tiger
'I killed the tiger.'


According to source B, auxiliary verbs are particles.


Choices: To implement this, we selected the SOV word order and ergative-absolutive paradigm under case. These two vhoices together along with the lexicon and morphology are what distinguish these sentences as grammatical and ungrammatical.

B. Case

(Lhasa) Tibetan has a range of 4-6 cases depending on the analysis because some wordforms cover multiple domains; due to their similarity DeLancey (Source C) refers to them as post-clitics

a. Ergative-instrumental: gis,gyis,kyis, -s after a vowel
b. Absolutitive: " "
c. Dative-Locative: la
d. Ablative:  nas/na
e. Genitive: gi/gyi/kyi

Unmarked items fall into the absolutitive case and ergative cases can be marked with -s as in "Example #1". Here are two examples showing that most transitive verbs take the absolutitive as their object, verbs such as hit take the dative as their argument

Example #3
Source: c:274
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c
thubbstangyis   blobzangla      gzhus_song
thubbstan-gyis  blobzang-la     gzhus_song
Thubten-ERG     Lobsang-DAT     hit_PRF
'Thubten hit Lobsang'

Example #4
Source: c:274
Vetted: s
Judgment: u
Phenomena: wo, c
thubbstangyis  blobzangla     bsadpared
thubbstan-gyis  blobzang-la   bsad-pa-red
Thubten-ERG     Lobsang-DAT   kill_PRF
'Thubten killed Lobsang'


Although the ergative and instrumental cases fall into the same bucket under DeLancey's analysis; The instrumental case can appear alongside an item in the ergative case:

Example #5
Source: b:203
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c
khos            yige            smyug_gus       bris_song
kho-s           yige            smyug-gus       bris_song
3sg-ERG         letter          pen-INST        wrote_aux
‘He wrote the letter with a pen.’


Choices: For our first grammar, we had to decide whether to make case part of all the different lexicon entries which would become cumbersome, make them clitics and/or morphological rules. Attempts were made to implement the various forms as clitics, but ultimately it was decided to use morphological rules because the nouns in our examples have been simple

C. Pronouns

D. Rest of NP

In source b, "determinants" are often refered to as noun particles. "cig" is one of the forms which contributes to the specificity of the noun it is joined with. They are not obligatory as illustrated in the following two examples:

Example #6
Source: d:100
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c,
`mi__bculngatsam cig yogred
`mi__bculngatsam cig yogred
PeopleFiteenAbout num exist
'There are about fiteeen people.'

Example #7
Source: d:100
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c,
`mi__bculngatsam  yogred
`mi__bculngatsam  yogred
PeopleFiteenAbout exist
'There are about fiteeen people.'

Choices: 
The simplest option was to include determiners as descrete words. There are some 

E. Tense/Aspect

According to source b, there are 4 tenses in Tibetan:
a. present
b. past
c. future
d. imperative

We have examples of them as follows

Example #8
#present tense
Source: b:137
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tam
ngas  yige    cig briskyiyod
ngas  yige    cig bris-kyi-yod
1ST-SBJ letter  num write-LK-AUX
'I am writing a letter.'

Example #9
#past tense
Source: b:137
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tam
ngas  yige    klogbayin
ngas  yige    klog-ba-yin
1ST-SBJ letter  read-LK-AUX
'I read the letter.'

Example #10
#FUTURE TENSE
Source: b:137
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tam
sangnyin  ngas    laska  'di   byedkyiyin
sangnyin  ngas    laska  'di   byed-kyi-yin
tomorrow  1ST-SBJ work   this  do-LK-AUX
'He is sure to do the work.'

#IMPERATIVE
Source: b:227
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tam
laska   'di     tsharba         byed    ''a    
work    this    finish-nom      do      IMP
'Try to finish the work'

For aspect, there is a perfect and imperfect.

Choices: we have not yet included negative examples or made choices with respect to these yet.

III. Testsuite instances not yet covered




IV. Coverage and Overgeneration

V. Inability to cope
