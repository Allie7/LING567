Lab 8 Writeup


A. Translation

To translate the sentences we added the relevant vocabulary as much as possible. Because to be hungry was a implemented as a phrase, we made a second definition of cold with the PRED value of "_hungry_a_rel". We also pulled an adverb "fast" from our adverb IGT and identified it as "quickly". Finally, we did find a definition for the word 'follow', so we used it in the place of "chase."

With vocabulary in place, there were some fixes to the grammar which needed to be done. As suggested in Lab 7, we got rid of variable property mapping pl -> sg, and redfined common nouns so they would not undergo plural inflection:

common_noun_lex-noun-lex := noun-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG [ PER 3rd],
    INFLECTED [ NUM-MARKER-RULE-FLAG +,
                CASE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG -,
                POSSESSIVE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG - ] ].


To translate possessive sentences, we added the fix to C-CONT.HCONS mentioned in class.

To translate sentences with eat, we implemented to the transitive to intransitive transfer rule shown in class.

+eat-mtr := monotonic_omtr &
+[ INPUT [ RELS <! [ PRED "_eat_v_rel", 
+                    ARG0 #arg0,
+                    ARG1 #arg1,
+                    ARG2 #arg2 ] !> ],
+  FILTER [ RELS <! [ARG0 #arg2 ] !> ],
+  OUTPUT [ RELS <! [ PRED "_eat_v_rel",
+                     ARG0 #arg0,
+                     ARG1 #arg1] !> ] ].


The vast majority of sentences translated as eat without a complement, included the noun meal as a complement. However, we were justified in creating an intransitive version of eat on the basis of one sentence. It does not appear in our testuite and won't parse:

Source: b:236
nga	dalta	za-long	med
I.ABS	now	eat-NMZ	exist.neg
"I have no time to eat now"

To implement questions, we had to modify a few things:

B. Translation results

We have 14/23 sentences translating from English and 13/20 parsing for Pite Saammi. You can read about the coverage of each sentence in translation_notes.en|sje

In general, the morphological variants present in our translation increase the outputs:  

ergative-lex-rule-suffix1 :=
%suffix (* gyis)(* gis)(* s)
ergative-lex-rule-lex-rule.

In reality, gyis and gis only appear after consonants, but we do not model that level of morphological detail for nouns. Another thing which increases the number of translations is the number of interrogative morphemes we have:

pas-interr-suffix :=
%suffix (* pas) (* pa)
pas-interr-lex-rule.

gas-interr-suffix :=
%suffix (* gas)
gas-interr-lex-rule.

bas-interr-suffix :=
%suffix (* bas)
bas-interr-lex-rule.

ngas-interr-suffix :=
%suffix (* ngas)
ngas-interr-lex-rule.

Another segment of the sentences don't parse because we are missing vocabulary for "think", but we do have "know".

A few of our translations parse, but are not translated.

Our first example is 

zhis	khyi	snyeg	gnyid
zhi-s	khyi	snyeg 	gnyid
cat.ERG	dog.ABS	chase	sleep
"Cats chase dogs and sleep"

The MRS looks OK, but it does not translate. While the ergative subject usually apears with transitive verbs and absolute subject appears with intransitive verbs, we have evidence that the ergative subject appears in such constructions:

Source: b:220
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: crd, crdagr, svc
zhoggas ngatshos        yige    bris    denas   khalag  bzas    denas   chamchamla      phyin   payin
zhoggas nga-tsho-s      yige    bris    denas   khalag  bzas    denas   chamcham-la     phyin   pa-yin
morning I-num-ERG       letter.ABS  write   then    meal.ABS   eat     then    walk-DAT        go.PST    LK-AUX
"In the morning we wrote letters, then we had a meal, then we went for a walk"

A few others parse for Tibetan but have broken MRS chains:

khyi	gnyid	rjesla	zhi	gnyid
khyi	gnyid	rjesla	zhi	gnyid
dog.ABS	sleep	after	cat	sleep
"The dog sleeps after the cat"

khos	khyis	pheb1gro	snyegpa		shes
kho-s   khyi-s	pheb1gro	snyeg-pa	shes
you.ERG	dog.ERG car		follow-NMZ	know
"You know that dogs chase cars"

Finally, there are the sentences which do not translate because we do not model the phenomena. Foremost, are the 3 sentences containing embedded interrogative clauses with the word "ask" which we have explained do not exist in Tibetan in previous labs. Another is S coordination--we do not have IGT or sources demonstrating this. Finally, we did not implement "because" because it appears as a subordinating clitic rather than a separate word as "after" and "before" do--modeling this would require returning to the customization system:

khyi	gnyidtsang	zhi	gnyid
khyi	gnyid-tsang	zhi	gnyid
dog	sleep-because	cat	sleep	 
"The dog sleeps because the cat sleeps"
