Lab 8 Writeup


A. Translation

To translate the sentences we added the relevant vocabulary as much as possible. Because to be hungry was a implemented as a phrase, we made a second definition of cold with the PRED value of "_hungry_a_rel". We also pulled an adverb "fast" from our adverb IGT and identified it as "quickly". Finally, we did find a definition for the word 'follow', so we used it in the place of "chase."

With vocabulary in place, there were some fixes to the grammar which needed to be done. As suggested in Lab 7, we got rid of variable property mapping pl -> sg, and redfined common nouns so they would not undergo plural inflection:

common_noun_lex-noun-lex := noun-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG [ PER 3rd],
    INFLECTED [ NUM-MARKER-RULE-FLAG +,
                CASE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG -,
                POSSESSIVE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG - ] ].


To translate possessive sentences, we added the fix to C-CONT.HCONS mentioned in class.

To translate sentences with eat, we implemented to the transitive to intransitive transfer rule shown in class.

+eat-mtr := monotonic_omtr &
+[ INPUT [ RELS <! [ PRED "_eat_v_rel", 
+                    ARG0 #arg0,
+                    ARG1 #arg1,
+                    ARG2 #arg2 ] !> ],
+  FILTER [ RELS <! [ARG0 #arg2 ] !> ],
+  OUTPUT [ RELS <! [ PRED "_eat_v_rel",
+                     ARG0 #arg0,
+                     ARG1 #arg1] !> ] ].


The vast majority of sentences translated as eat without a complement, included the noun meal as a complement. However, we were justified in creating an intransitive version of eat on the basis of one sentence. It does not appear in our testuite and won't parse:

Source: b:236
nga	dalta	za-long	med
I.ABS	now	eat-NMZ	exist.neg
"I have no time to eat now"

To implement questions, we had to modify a few things in the semi.vpm file. The eng and sje grammar does not have mood specified. In Tibetan we have 6 real mood types and a default type no-mood. In the translation part of this assignment, we only need interr mood for questions and indic mood for normal sentences. So we made the following changes in the tibetan.tdl : 

interr+indic := mood.
interr := interr+indic.
indic := interr+indc.

the changes to the semi.vpm

+ E.MOOD : MOOD
 +   emph <> emph
 +   corrob <> corrob
 +   apparent <> apparent
 +   possible <> possible
 +   * >> no-mood
 +   interr+indic << [e]


B. Clean-ups:

We tried to work on the problems left last week. The mrs chain breaks at the comp-head phrase "zhedrag grangmo yogredbas" when we tried to parse the following :

Source: b:275
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena:q
bodla           dgunkha         zhedrag grangmo         yogredbas
bod-la          dgunkha         zhedrag grang-mo        yogred-bas
Tibet-LOC       winter.ABS      very    cold-NMZ        exist-INTERR
"Are winters very cold in Tibet?"

To solve this, we tried to implement the adverbs and adjectives as Professor Bender advices :

"What you want is a lexical entry for zhedrag that is an adverb ([ HEAD adv ]), which contributes a relation with the PRED value _very_x_deg.  The ARG1 of that should end up being the ARG0 of _cold_a_rel, and they should have the same LBL.  The should combine via a head-spec rule, so the adjective cold should have a non-empty SPR value that wants something that is [ HEAD adv ], and the adverb should have a non-empty SPEC value that wants something that is [ HEAD adj ] and that identifies the INDEX of the SPEC with its own KEYREL.ARG1 and the LTOP of the SPEC with its own LTOP."

We changed the following:
nom-adj-verb-lex-adj-lex := attr-adj-lex & norm-zero-arg &
[ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ POSTHEAD +,
                     VAL [ SUBJ < >,
                           SPR < [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD adv ] > ],
                           HEAD.PRD + ] ].

 

adverb-adj-lex := basic-adverb-lex & intersective-mod-lex &
[ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [  VAL [ SPR < >,
                                SUBJ < >,
                                COMPS < >,
                                SPEC < [ LOCAL [ CAT.HEAD adj ] ] > ] ] ] ] ].


head-spec-phrase := basic-head-spec-phrase & head-final. ;;HEAD-SPEC used to be head-initial.

This makes the adverbs and adj go throught the HEAD-SPEC rule sucessfully, but it fails when the whole VP phrase tries to unify with the subject. there was a conflict in the ARG0 of the adjective : event / ref-ind.

We also did the following modification to locative-pp-phrase to fix the mrs so that The ARG1 and LBL of _loc_p_rel are identified with the ARG0 and LBL of _cold_a_rel:

locative-pp-phrase := unary-phrase &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD adp & [ MOD < [ LOCAL intersective-mod &
                                                    [ CAT.HEAD verb,
						      CONT.HOOK [ INDEX #arg1,
								  LTOP #lbl ] ] ] > ],
		          VAL [ COMPS < >,
			        SUBJ < >, 
			        SPR < > ]]],
    C-CONT [ HOOK [ LTOP #ltop,
		    INDEX #index,
		    XARG #xarg ],
	     RELS <! arg12-ev-relation &
		   [ PRED "_loc_p_rel",
		     LBL #ltop,
		     ARG0 #index,
		     ARG1 #xarg,
		     ARG2 #dtr ] !>,
	     HCONS <! !>  ],
    ARGS < [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD noun & [CASE loc],
				  VAL.SPR < > ],
			    CONT.HOOK [ INDEX #dtr ]],
		      LKEYS.KEYREL [ ARG1 #arg1,
				     LBL #lbl ] ] ] > ].

Strangely, doing this fixed the breaking mrs of adverbs-adj, but it does not do what it is supposed to do.The locative PP phrase is broken with the rest of the sentence.

We deleted the above changes so that they won't influence the grammar's performance.
