Lab 8 Writeup


A. Translation

To translate the sentences we added the relevant vocabulary as much as possible. Because to be hungry was a implemented as a phrase, we made a second definition of cold with the PRED value of "_hungry_a_rel". We also pulled an adverb "fast" from our adverb IGT and identified it as "quickly". Finally, we did find a definition for the word 'follow', so we used it in the place of "chase."

With vocabulary in place, there were some fixes to the grammar which needed to be done. As suggested in Lab 7, we got rid of variable property mapping pl -> sg, and redfined common nouns so they would not undergo plural inflection:

common_noun_lex-noun-lex := noun-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG [ PER 3rd],
    INFLECTED [ NUM-MARKER-RULE-FLAG +,
                CASE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG -,
                POSSESSIVE-MARKER-RULE-FLAG - ] ].


To translate possessive sentences, we added the fix to C-CONT.HCONS mentioned in class.

To translate sentences with eat, we implemented to the transitive to intransitive transfer rule shown in class.

+eat-mtr := monotonic_omtr &
+[ INPUT [ RELS <! [ PRED "_eat_v_rel", 
+                    ARG0 #arg0,
+                    ARG1 #arg1,
+                    ARG2 #arg2 ] !> ],
+  FILTER [ RELS <! [ARG0 #arg2 ] !> ],
+  OUTPUT [ RELS <! [ PRED "_eat_v_rel",
+                     ARG0 #arg0,
+                     ARG1 #arg1] !> ] ].


The vast majority of sentences translated as eat without a complement, included the noun meal as a complement. However, we were justified in creating an intransitive version of eat on the basis of one sentence. It does not appear in our testuite and won't parse:

Source: b:236
nga	dalta	za-long	med
I.ABS	now	eat-NMZ	exist.neg
"I have no time to eat now"

To implement questions, we had to modify a few things in the semi.vpm file. The eng and sje grammar does not have mood specified. In Tibetan we have 6 real mood types and a default type no-mood. In the translation part of this assignment, we only need interr mood for questions and indic mood for normal sentences. So we made the following changes in the tibetan.tdl : 

interr+indic := mood.
interr := interr+indic.
indic := interr+indc.

the changes to the semi.vpm

+ E.MOOD : MOOD
 +   emph <> emph
 +   corrob <> corrob
 +   apparent <> apparent
 +   possible <> possible
 +   * >> no-mood
 +   interr+indic << [e]
