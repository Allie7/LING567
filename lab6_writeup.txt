Lab 6 Writeup

A. Yes-no questions

Yes-no questinons have the appropriate MRS. The SF value for the verb situation is ques. We have no evidence of a question focus clitic as in Russian ("li").

you             Tibet-DAT       go.HON  experiential.AUX-INTERR
"Have you ever been to Tibet?"

The implementation of this is the same as it was in the previous grammar.  

B. Embedded clauses

For the most part, embedded clauses are the same since we have not found examples of embedded interrogative complementary clauses. According to source B (108) and IGT in source E (136), the verb for ask and say is the same "zhu". The following IGT examples are not part of the testsuite and will not parse.

Source: c:118
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: speech
nga	yong	giyin	zer
nga	yong	gi-yin	zer
I	come	LK-AUX	say
"' I'll come,' he says."

Furthermore, source D claims that form-wise indirect and direct speech are the same and that there are circumstances of "hybrid" reported speech which involves the use of the honorific system. Source B states gives an example of this in which the use of an honorific verb is used but mutually understood to indicate that those '"quoted" words' were not used because of lower honorific status of the speaker:

Source: c:217
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: speech
nga	phebs		kyiyin	gsungs	kyi1dug
nga	phebs		kyi-yin	gsungs	kyi-1dug
I	come.HON	FUT-AUX	say	LK-AUX
"She says she will come. (Lit. She says 'I shall come.')"

We have a source which shows a quoted question showing an interrogative mood marker at the end of the sentence:

Source: f:89
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: speech
blordorgyis	1aphralmar	dobdag	gangdu	yoddam		zhes	dris
blordor-gyis	1aphralmar	dobdag	gangdu	yod-dam		zhes	dris
Lodor-ERG	immediately	ownder	where	exist.INTERR	say	ask.PST
"Lobdor immediately asked, 'Where is the owner?'"

This doesn't necessarily disprove that embedded interrogative complement clauses exist in the language, but it suggests that's the case.

For embedded declarative clauses, the grammar remains the same as it was before and most work:

Source: c:284
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: emb-d
khos    laska           byedyag                 1gobtsugs               song
kho-s   laska           byed-yag                1gobtsugs               song
He-ERG  work.ABS        do.PST-NMZ              start.PST               PRF
"He started to work"

One which exhibits fronting doesn't (S subj V):

Source: c:284
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: emb-d
nga     bodla           phyinpa         khos    shes    kyi
nga     bod-la          phyin-pa        kho-s   shes    kyi
I.ABS   Tibet-DAT       go.PST-NMZ      he-ERG  know    AUX
"He knows I went to Tibet"

The implementation remains yet the same as it was the previous lab. There was an issue with the root unifying with NMZ clauses to form a full sentence in generation and parsing. We, therefore, added a constraint to the root node to prohibit this:

root := sign &
   [ SYNSEM [ NON-LOCAL non-local-none,
              LOCAL [ COORD -,
-                     CAT [ VAL [ SUBJ < >,
+                     CAT [ HEAD.NMZ -, 
+                           VAL [ SUBJ < >,

We added a corresponding testsuite item--"pa", the most common nominalization suffix would create a grammatical interrogative sentence:

#
# ending in nominalization

Phenomena: emb-d
kho     laska           byed    yodmkhan
kho     laska           byed    yod-mkhan
he.ABS  work.ABS        do      AUX-NMZ
"He is working"

C. Wh-questions

In Tibetan, wh questions are formulated in-situ with the pronouns undergoing through case declension with an interrogative mood marker on the last verb. To implement this, we followed the instructions. 

We added wh-pronouns and made them go through the case marking and possessive rules for the sake of consistency with other nouns--we do not have evidence that the wh-pronouns can be plural:

wh-pronoun-noun-lex := case-marker-rule-dtr & possessive-rule-lex-rule-dtr & norm-hook-lex-item & basic-icons-lex-item &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD noun,
                           VAL [ SPR < >,
                                 SUBJ < >,
                                 COMPS < >,
                                 SPEC < > ] ],
                     CONT [ HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PER 3rd,
                            RELS <! [ LBL #larg,
                                       ARG0 #ind & ref-ind ],
                                  [ PRED "wh_q_rel",
                                    ARG0 #ind,
                                    RSTR #harg ] !>,
                            HCONS <! [ HARG #harg,
                                        LARG #larg ] !> ] ],
             NON-LOCAL.QUE <! #ind !> ] ].

su := wh-pronoun-noun-lex &
  [ STEM < "su" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_person_n_rel" ].

We added the wh-int-cl clause:

wh-int-cl := clause & head-compositional &  head-only &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL.CAT [ VAL #val,
			 MC bool ],
	     NON-LOCAL non-local-none ],
    C-CONT [ RELS <! !>,
	     HCONS <! !>,
	     HOOK.INDEX.SF ques ],
    HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD verb & [ FORM finite ],
				  VAL #val & 
				    [ SUBJ < >,
				      COMPS < > ] ],
		      NON-LOCAL [ SLASH <! !>,
				  REL <! !>,
				  QUE <! ref-ind !> ] ] ].

We also added (and renamed) the eng-subj-phrase-rule:

bod-subj-head-phrase := head-valence-phrase & head-compositional &
              basic-binary-headed-phrase &
  [ SYNSEM phr-synsem &
           [ LOCAL.CAT [ POSTHEAD +,
                 HC-LIGHT -,
                 VAL [ SUBJ < >,
                       COMPS #comps,
                       SPR #spr ] ] ],
    C-CONT [ HOOK.INDEX.SF prop-or-ques,
         RELS <! !>,
         HCONS <! !>,
         ICONS <! !> ],
    HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL [ SUBJ < #synsem >,
                    COMPS #comps,    
                    SPR #spr ],
    NON-HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM #synsem & canonical-synsem &
       [ LOCAL [ CAT [ VAL [ SUBJ olist,
                 COMPS olist,
                 SPR olist ] ] ],
         NON-LOCAL [ SLASH 0-dlist & [ LIST < > ],
             REL 0-dlist ] ]].

Of our readily available sentences which come from authoritative sources, the only one which parses involves a copular verb:

Source: b:130
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wh,c
kyedrang   su    yinpa
kyedrang   su    yin-pa
you         who   be-INTERR
'Who are you?'

Based on evidence, we do know that wh-pronouns decline; this example does not parse because we do not implement the ablative case or adjunct phrases:

Source: b:165
Vetted: s
Judgement: g
Phenomena: c,wh
kyedrang        ganas           phebspa
kyedrang        ga-nas          phebs-pa
you             what-ABL        come-INTERR
'Where did you come from?'

Another example which doesn't parse due to fronting among other things:

Source: b:197
Vetted: s
Judgement: g
Phenomena: c, wh
chalag  digyad          sus             tshong  paredpa
chalag  di-gyad         su-s            tshong  pa-red-pa
thing   this-NUM        who-ERG         sell    LK-AUX-Q
'Who sold the things?'

Based on this, we created what we suppose are simpler, grammatical questions

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wh, c,
sus             stag            bsad            paredpas
su-s            stag            bsad            pa-yin-pas
who-ERG         tiger.ABS       kill.PST        LK-AUX.PRF
'Who killed the tiger?'

We suppose the following is accurate, but it doesn't parse; there was a unification failure between null and 1-list in the second item of LOCAL.QUE.LIST--similar to the initial modifications for question pronouns:

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wh, c,
sus             su      bsad            paredpas
su-s            su      bsad            pa-yin-pas
who-ERG         whom.ABS  kill.PST        LK-AUX.PRF
'Who killed whom?'

Since it is considered optional, we focused on other things.

We have not been able to find instances of question pronouns in lower clauses, so we do not model it.


D. One corpus sentence



E. Grammar improvements

One thing which helped improve the generation this week was the dramatic reduction of inflection rules in the morphology. 

Between this week and last week, we were able to make the following not parse by
specifying the FORM becomes finite when a verb is inflected in the interrogative:

pas-interr-lex-rule := interr-marker-rule-lex-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM finite  ,
    DTR.INFLECTED.1DUG-AUX-OR-1DUG-VERB-OR-BYUNG-AUX-OR-SONG-AUX-OR-SONG-VERB-OR-YONG-AUX-FLAG na ].

you             Tibet-DAT       go.HON-Q        experiential-Q
"Have you ever been to Tibet?"

F. Coverage and Overgeneration

		Baseline	Current	
Coverage 	47/83		47/83
Ambiguity	1.81		2.34
Overgeneration	1/31		0/31

One reason that ambiguity has increased is that we now have issues with the wh-in-situ clause firing because mood is underspecified--we have interr specified but that will still unify with the underspecified "mood". With a forthcoming major refactoring of the grammar, we will have an obligatory succession of verb inflection rules which will allow us to take care of the underspecification issues.   
Another way in which ambiguity has increased is that the wh-pronoun seems to optionally go through the possessive inflection rule.







G. Test Corpus

We collected a test corpus from the back of source B. We had our choice of a conversation, a narrative style story, and a synthetic conversation for teaching purposes. We chose the first 10 sentences in a conversation which involve questions and the like. We may add more examples from another discursive quality if this proves too difficult. The lines are like the IGT; we are targeting the translit line.
