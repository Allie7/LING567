Lab 6 Writeup


A. Yes-no questions

Yes-no questinons have the correct semantics. The SF value for the verb situation is ques. We have no evidence of a question focus clitic as in Russian.


B. Embedded clauses

For the most part, emb

C. Wh-questions

D.


F. Coverage and Overgeneration

		Baseline	Current	
Coverage 	42/80		47/80
Ambiguity	3.6		1.8
Overgeneration	1/30		1/30

The coverage has increased thanks in part due to the work on the phenomena this week as well, new phenomena covered and increases in vocabulary. 

Unfortunately, one of our sentences still continues to parse despite our additions of form to the FORM system:

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: q
khyedrang       bodla           phebspas        myongngas
khyedrang       bod-la          phebs-pas       myong-ngas
you             Tibet-DAT       go.HON-Q        experiential-Q
"Have you ever been to Tibet?"

G. Test Corpus

We collected a test corpus from the back of source B. We had our choice of a conversation, a narrative style story, and a synthetic conversation for teaching purposes. We chose the first 10 sentences in a conversation which involve questions and the like. We may add more examples from another discursive quality if this proves too difficult. The lines are like the IGT; we are targeting the translit line.
